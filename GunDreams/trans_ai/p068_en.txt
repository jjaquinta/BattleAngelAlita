She had used the technique. A savage impulse welled up instantly, along with pride in the technique she had acquired. It felt as if she was far removed from her current self, yet at the same time, it was a deeply nostalgic memory of battle. These thoughts filled Gally's mind, and the density of them caused her brain cells to heat up, nearly boiling over.
Who was I? That a piece of my heart could burn so fiercely like this...?
At that moment, Gally was bewildered by a wave of emotions that could neither be defined as fear nor joy. As she stood there in confusion, sharp murderous intent, like a blade, was rapidly approaching from behind.
"...Quite a technique, young lady,"
Rinna swiftly attacked Gally like a phoenix, or perhaps like lightning, executing a forward roll and gaining some distance.
"Who are you!?"
Gally's entire body tingled with an instinctive reaction, as she sharply glared at the one who had kicked her, staring at Gally with trembling eyes.
