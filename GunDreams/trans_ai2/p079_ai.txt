"By the way, girl, you said your name was Gally, right? Where did you learn that technique?" Gally gave a wry smile at Kyariko's question and replied, "I don't really know. I was just brought back to life by Ido. I still don't understand much about myself."

The various martial arts techniques that had surged up from deep within her heart were still sinking back into the fog of her memories, hidden in the depths of her mind. It seemed that her memories would only surface in moments of extreme stress, triggered by specific situations.

"Hey Kyariko, do you think we'll meet again sometime?" Gally asked suddenly. Kyariko scratched her head, letting her gaze drift into the night sky, then flicked her cigarette away. Without looking back at Gally, she disappeared into the direction of the entertainment district.
