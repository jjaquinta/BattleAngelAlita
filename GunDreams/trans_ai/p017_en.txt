"What, what the hell is going on!?"

The machete gripped in his left hand spun rapidly as it fell and stabbed into the asphalt of the alley. The shadow did not dodge the man’s quickly descending machete, but instead struck his wrist from the side at a speed that far surpassed the force of the machete.

The shadow's kick was nothing short of art. It was as graceful as a waterfowl spreading its wings to take flight into the sky, yet at the same time, it concealed the destructive power of a raptor’s talons ripping through its prey. The machete blade plunged downward, but in contrast, the shadow’s folded leg shot upward in a knee-like motion. Then, as the heel of the supporting foot lifted off the ground, the shadow pivoted on the ball of the foot, turning inward. The moment the knee and lower leg twisted sharply inward, the force of the kick reached its peak, impacting the man’s wrist holding the machete and severing it cleanly.
