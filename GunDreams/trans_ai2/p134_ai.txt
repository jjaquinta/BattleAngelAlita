All Calico could do was glare weakly as Norinco tossed away his broken knife and drew a new one. 

"Shyyyaaahhh!"

The large knife, sharp as a blade, showed no mercy as it dug into Calico’s defenseless cyborg body. The same tough special steel that had withstood her heated blade was now slowly being chipped away by the heavy, grinding strikes of Norinco's knife. The blows echoed off the walls as they bit deeper into her body. 

With each frenzied strike, Norinco’s knife hacked through Calico’s left arm, severing it below the elbow, while her right leg dangled loosely, nearly torn off. Her once powerful body was reduced to a tattered mess, the outer casing shattered and mangled.

"Kyyaaah!"

Norinco delivered the final blow, a brutal diagonal slash that cleaved her body apart. The twenty-centimeter-long blade sunk deeply into the steel frame of her torso, tearing through her cyborg body like a rag. Her right side and head, now shredded like worn-out fabric, fell from the wall and rolled across the wet ground, coming to a stop against the sewer grate.

"......."
