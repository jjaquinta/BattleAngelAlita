"Ah, I’m so relieved. It looks like my body still remembers how to walk. Hey, Ido, does this mean I've finally become a proper person?" Gally asked, looking up at Ido's face. Just weeks ago, she had been nothing more than a piece of scrap buried in the junkyard, and now she stood before Ido, smiling with the joy of walking.

"Getting your body back together is just the starting point of your life. You have to keep living from here on," Ido said.

"Keep living...? Yeah, you're right," Gally repeated, as if reflecting on Ido’s words. Right now, Gally was alive thanks to Ido. Perhaps she was even living for Ido at this moment. If Ido hadn’t found her, Gally would have never had a life at all. Yet, she wasn’t sure if this was truly her own life. 

As she gained control over her body, a vague sense of questioning began to stir within Gally’s heart. Now, she would have to search for what it truly meant to live.
