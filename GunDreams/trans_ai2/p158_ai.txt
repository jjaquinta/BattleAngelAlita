Bergman shoved the old man, who was clinging to his legs, pushing him onto the street. “What’s going on, Bergman?” Gally asked as she watched the scene unfold.

Bergman, who had a stern look on his face, softened slightly when he saw Gally and explained the situation. "Yeah, well, this homeless guy keeps begging me for some food or chips in exchange for parts, but he’s got nothing worth trading. On top of that, he’s being a real nuisance, so I chased him off."

Bergman crossed his square-shaped arms over his chest and let out a frustrated sigh. Gally responded with a nonchalant “Hmm,” then turned to the dirty old man who had curled up in front of the shop. 

“Hey, old man, did you take care of that doll made from the cyborg body? It’s surprisingly clean,” she asked.

The old man, dragging himself towards the cart, responded with a raspy voice mixed with wheezing. “Doll? I don’t know anything about a doll.”

Gally, confused by his answer, furrowed her brows and asked again.
