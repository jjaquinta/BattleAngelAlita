"Shyunufu... ughhh!" 

After the violent collapse, as the dust settled and the scene revealed itself, the entire area had turned into a mountain of rubble, with not a single pillar left standing. 

After a brief pause, something shifted beneath the debris, and Gally slowly stood up, though she had lost her left arm below the elbow, the steel limb having been severed during the fight. "Did I get him...?" Gally muttered, glancing around as she exhaled deeply.

But in the next moment, with a sudden thud, the rubble shifted, and Norinco emerged, seemingly unscathed despite the massive collapse. 

"Shyuuuu... That gutsy resolve of yours is something else for such a young girl. But it looks like luck is on my side," Norinco sneered.

Gally, sweating from her brow, kept her eyes locked on him, tense. But after a moment, her stern expression softened, and a slight smile crossed her face.
