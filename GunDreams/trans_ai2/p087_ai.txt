"Oh my, if it isn't Gally-chan. You shouldn't be coming to a place like this, it's not good for a kid's upbringing," Kyariko said, waving her hand dismissively as if to shoo them away.

"Kyariko, Gally here says she wants to become a Hunter. She came all this way just to ask you," Shig said, wedging her foot in the door as Kyariko tried to retreat back into the room. Kyariko sighed and pulled out a cigarette.

"Kyariko-san, since I woke up, I haven't had anyone to rely on. I really don't know anything—about this town or anything. Even though I want to become a Hunter-Warrior, I just... don’t know where to start," Gally pleaded, her words filled with desperation as Kyariko exhaled smoke with an exasperated look.

"Come on, Kyariko. Don't be mean—just tell Gally how to register as a Hunter. You only need to take her to the Factory, it's not that hard," Shig said, siding with Gally.

Reluctantly, Kyariko scratched her head and released a long sigh, expelling all the air she had held in her lungs.
