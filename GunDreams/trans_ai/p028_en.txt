Deep down, she had been asleep. Naturally, her state was one of deactivation, akin to death. The consciousness that had once governed her body had long since vanished into the void, and much time had passed since then. It had already been hundreds of years since she was buried here. The girlâ€™s body was mechanical. After all this time, she lay in the sea of scrap metal without any sense of incongruity because her body was made of steel and ceramic, a man-made object.

"A... ah... ugh!"

When Ido Daisuke found the girl in the pile of scrap, he was so shocked that he slipped and tumbled several meters down into the heap of debris. Oh, within the scrap, there slumbered a mechanical angel. The joy of discovering something valuable among the junk is something eternal to all men. He climbed the gentle slope and crouched next to the rusted girl. Her hair was already gone, but her rounded, egg-shaped external appearance seemed to belong to a fifteen- or sixteen-year-old.
