"By the time you return, make sure to wash your face, so you donâ€™t scare the baby," Belchere said with a soft smile. It was only then that Norinco realized his body was still covered in dried blood, giving him a dark, mottled appearance. Shrugging lightly, he left the room.

After walking for about thirty minutes, Norinco arrived at the Factory. He handed over all the bounty heads to Deckman, the human interface inside the Factory, and exchanged them for chips.

"One hundred and ten thousand chips, huh... not bad," Norinco muttered to himself as he walked through the snow-covered alley, jingling the chips in his pocket. Even after paying off his debts, he would have forty thousand chips left.

Instead of heading straight home, Norinco decided to make a slight detour. "Might as well celebrate the birth of my child a little early," he thought as he stepped through the door of his usual bar on the main street. By adjusting the alcohol decomposition function, even a cyborg could enjoy a drink. 

For about an hour, he quietly drank alone, contemplating names for his unborn child, wondering if it would be a boy or a girl.
