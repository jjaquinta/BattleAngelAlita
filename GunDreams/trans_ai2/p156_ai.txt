The Scrapyard may have its changing sides, but it didn’t seem to transform into a completely different town. As Gally left the crowded main street and ventured down a few side alleys, she found herself in a quieter area with sparse shops. According to the map, she only had to walk a bit further to reach Bergman's rental body shop.

"This must be it. Looks like Bergman’s place," Gally said to herself after walking about three minutes, arriving at a shop called "Catch." The building's walls were covered with countless embedded cyborg body parts, all arranged to depict various throwing techniques. The entrance door had "Catch" hastily scrawled in red paint, with no clear sign indicating it was a rental body shop.

“Hm, what is this?” Gally chuckled as she looked up at the building but soon noticed a battered cart placed near the entrance. The cart’s bed was piled high with mysterious parts, machinery, and broken cyborg components. The precarious stack seemed like it could collapse at the slightest touch, adding to the chaotic vibe of the shop.
