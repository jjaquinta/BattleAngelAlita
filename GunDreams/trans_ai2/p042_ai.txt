"Is this... me?" Gally widened her large, dark eyes in genuine surprise as Ido held up the mirror he had brought from the sink, showing her reflection. Her straight, fine black hair had been neatly restored, and the damaged facial skin had been replaced with fresh, synthetic skin. When she had been found, Gally's face had been weathered and damaged in several places, but now it had been repaired to look as flawless as a real girl's face, with no trace of scars.

“Thank you, Ido,” Gally said. 

Ido scratched his head, embarrassed by her gratitude. "Ah, no, it's nothing... we're not done yet. I still need to finish putting together a proper body for you."

Gally smiled softly at his words and glanced downward. While her head and neck had been fully restored, her torso and limbs were still incomplete. Although Ido had managed to gather internal parts like artificial organs, a synthetic spine, and a generator, he had yet to obtain a female body frame or limbs to complete her exterior.
