Ido, still facing away from Gally, muttered as if to himself. "For your sake, I'd gladly sever any criminal's head. I'd bathe in their blood without hesitation. But... I want you to remain my dream."

"Ido..." Gally felt a tightening pain in her chest, as if her heart were being crushed. In this world, no one cared for her as deeply as Ido did.

"I just want to make you into something more beautiful," Ido continued, turning to face her, his voice strained and anguished. But Gally, like a butterfly slipping through his fingers, left the room.

"I'm sorry, Ido... but I can't be your dress-up doll."

Left alone in the room, Ido wept.

Gally wandered aimlessly through the bustling streets of the pleasure district. Having left Ido, she was lost, unsure of what to do or where to go. Should she really pursue becoming a Hunter Warrior?
