However, in front of the cart piled with filthy junk, something oddly out of place caught her eye. “Wow, that’s pretty,” Gally said. It was a female cyborg body with a mannequin head perched on top, seated on a makeshift chair at the front of the cart. The doll, dressed in cute, girlish clothes, was kept unnaturally pristine compared to its surroundings.

As Gally examined the odd display on the cart, a pleading voice came from inside Bergman’s shop. “Please, I’m begging you... I’m begging you!” A moment later, the shop door opened, and an elderly blind man, a full-body cyborg with a cloth wrapped around his eyes, was pushed outside by Bergman.

“Come on, please, Mr. Bergman, have mercy on me...” the old man begged. 

“You didn’t bring anything worth my time today. I’m not in the market for useless parts. Sorry, try somewhere else,” Bergman replied dismissively.
