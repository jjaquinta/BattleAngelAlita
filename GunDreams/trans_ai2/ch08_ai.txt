CHAPTER 8


“Gally, haven’t you been getting up a bit late recently?” Ido called from the clinic, just poking his head out to speak when he saw Gally finally come down from the bedroom on the second floor around noon.

“Yeah, sorry,” Gally replied, still sleepy, as she made her way to the dining room.

“By the way, Gally, I’m thinking of going hunting tonight. Want to come along?”As Gally quietly ate her late breakfast, which was more like lunch at this point, Ido entered the dining room, rolling his neck and shoulders as he spoke. However, her response was hesitant and unenthusiastic. “Well, um, tonight… I kind of…”

Gally was feeling tired from her activities the previous night, but more than that, she declined Ido’s offer out of a subtle sense of rebellion. After all, she had taken down two bounty heads on her own just the day before.

Ido noticed her attitude and furrowed his brow, looking at her with a somewhat disappointed gaze. “What’s the matter, Gally? You were so interested in hunter work. Don’t tell me you’ve already lost interest?”

Gally shook her head quickly in response and, after finishing her meal, stood up from the table. “Sorry, that’s not it… I just don’t feel up to it tonight. But I promise I’ll go next time.”

With that, Gally hurriedly left the dining room and bolted out of the house. Ido stood frozen for a moment, as if trying to call her back, but after a while, he let out a sigh and slumped slightly, feeling drained.Ido sat down in a chair, reflecting. “Gally... you were so fixated on being a Hunter, on fighting, so why now?” Could it be that Gally is hiding something from me? As this thought crossed his mind, he felt something dark stir deep within him, causing a faint tremor. It was a black emotion, akin to jealousy. “My Gally...” Ido muttered, lowering his head over the table.

Meanwhile, Gally was walking down the bustling main street in the early afternoon, surrounded by crowds of people. “Wow… it's so lively during the day,” she remarked. The people filling the streets during the day were mostly workers and shoppers, creating a comparatively bright and lively atmosphere. However, that didn’t mean the junkies or collapsed homeless had disappeared, and in some corners of the street, drug deals and shady dealings were happening out in the open, even in broad daylight. The atmosphere, while vibrant, still carried hints of its rough edges.The Scrapyard may have its changing sides, but it didn’t seem to transform into a completely different town. As Gally left the crowded main street and ventured down a few side alleys, she found herself in a quieter area with sparse shops. According to the map, she only had to walk a bit further to reach Bergman's rental body shop.

"This must be it. Looks like Bergman’s place," Gally said to herself after walking about three minutes, arriving at a shop called "Catch." The building's walls were covered with countless embedded cyborg body parts, all arranged to depict various throwing techniques. The entrance door had "Catch" hastily scrawled in red paint, with no clear sign indicating it was a rental body shop.

“Hm, what is this?” Gally chuckled as she looked up at the building but soon noticed a battered cart placed near the entrance. The cart’s bed was piled high with mysterious parts, machinery, and broken cyborg components. The precarious stack seemed like it could collapse at the slightest touch, adding to the chaotic vibe of the shop.However, in front of the cart piled with filthy junk, something oddly out of place caught her eye. “Wow, that’s pretty,” Gally said. It was a female cyborg body with a mannequin head perched on top, seated on a makeshift chair at the front of the cart. The doll, dressed in cute, girlish clothes, was kept unnaturally pristine compared to its surroundings.

As Gally examined the odd display on the cart, a pleading voice came from inside Bergman’s shop. “Please, I’m begging you... I’m begging you!” A moment later, the shop door opened, and an elderly blind man, a full-body cyborg with a cloth wrapped around his eyes, was pushed outside by Bergman.

“Come on, please, Mr. Bergman, have mercy on me...” the old man begged. 

“You didn’t bring anything worth my time today. I’m not in the market for useless parts. Sorry, try somewhere else,” Bergman replied dismissively.Bergman shoved the old man, who was clinging to his legs, pushing him onto the street. “What’s going on, Bergman?” Gally asked as she watched the scene unfold.

Bergman, who had a stern look on his face, softened slightly when he saw Gally and explained the situation. "Yeah, well, this homeless guy keeps begging me for some food or chips in exchange for parts, but he’s got nothing worth trading. On top of that, he’s being a real nuisance, so I chased him off."

Bergman crossed his square-shaped arms over his chest and let out a frustrated sigh. Gally responded with a nonchalant “Hmm,” then turned to the dirty old man who had curled up in front of the shop. 

“Hey, old man, did you take care of that doll made from the cyborg body? It’s surprisingly clean,” she asked.

The old man, dragging himself towards the cart, responded with a raspy voice mixed with wheezing. “Doll? I don’t know anything about a doll.”

Gally, confused by his answer, furrowed her brows and asked again."You don't know? I mean the cyborg body doll sitting in the front seat of this cart. Isn't that yours, old man?"

"Ahh... Br-... Breda, Breda!!" The old man panicked, shaking his white hair wildly as Gally pressed him further. Stumbling around to the front of the cart, he reached out and carefully pulled the doll seated there towards him, holding it tightly in both arms. "Shushu... Breda, Breda... Oh, I told you, didn’t I? You shouldn’t talk to strangers! It’ll be too late if something happens to you... You’re such a delicate girl..."

Seeing the old man’s frantic behavior, Gally stood there with her mouth slightly open, unable to comprehend the situation. Bergman gently tapped her on the shoulder and shook his head slightly. The old man had already forgotten everything else, his mind entirely consumed by the doll he called Breda.

"Let’s go home, Breda... I know you must be a little hungry, but forgive me, alright?" The old man muttered as he slowly pulled the old cart, disappearing down the street.

"Wait, the body might be impressive, but the head is just a doll, right?" Gally asked, still puzzled.

"Yeah, Gally, that’s just a regular doll. The old man lost his mind a long time ago," Bergman responded, sighing."The old man's completely gone in the head. He used to be a skilled Hunter called Norinco, but now he's lost his eyesight and ended up like that," Bergman said.

Gally responded with a simple "Hmm," quickly losing interest in the old man. Her focus was on checking out the Hunter-grade combat cyborg bodies available in Bergman's shop.

"Hey, Bergman, um... What kind of Hunter bodies do you have?" Gally asked, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

Bergman gave her a wink and a thumbs-up, grinning. "You came back the day after already? Don't worry, kid, my stock is the best in the Eastern District. Whatever your budget, I can get you exactly what you need. Come on in."

"Awesome! I wonder if you have a body like Calico’s? It must be super expensive though," Gally said as the two of them laughed and disappeared into the shop.
