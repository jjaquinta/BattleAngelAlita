"She's the youngest of the sisters. Her crimes include multiple murders and assaults. The bounty on her head is a modest 32,000 chips," the red-haired woman said, handing Gally a printout of the bounty list. Gally let out a long sigh of relief after reading it.

"Feeling better now? Ido, well... he's one of the decent ones. He doesn't take on bodyguard gigs like I do. I mean, he only hunts small fry on the side, probably not out of desperation. Still, he's doing alright," the red-haired woman continued.

Gally now understood the truthâ€”that Ido was working as a Hunter-Warrior to earn money to repair her body. The red-haired woman also explained that the body parts were acquired cheaply from corpse recovery dealers.

"Honestly, you were taking everything Shig and the others said so seriously, I couldn't resist messing with you a little," the woman added with a smirk. Her name was Kyariko, another Hunter-Warrior like Ido. She mentioned that she had met Ido once or twice before. Kyariko pulled a crumpled cigarette from her coat pocket and lit it, exhaling purple smoke.
