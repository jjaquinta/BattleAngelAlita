The red-haired woman shook the dazed Gally, slapping her face lightly. "Come on, get a grip, okay? That wasn’t a big deal at all. It’s just the work of a Hunter, you know."

Gradually, the vacant look in Gally’s eyes began to regain focus and determination.

"Ido isn’t a serial killer," the red-haired woman continued. "He’s a Hunter who hunts serial killers, understand?"

Gally fully snapped out of her daze and grabbed the front of the red-haired woman’s clothes. "A Hunter? What do you mean, a Hunter? He just killed that woman!"

The red-haired woman explained to Gally about the existence of Hunter-Warriors in The Scrapyard. In The Scrapyard, the Factory maintained public order by placing bounties on the heads of criminals who committed any crime outside of those sanctioned by the Factory or Zalem. Hunter-Warriors were professional killers who tracked down and eliminated these criminals listed on the bounty list.

"So, that woman Ido just killed was..."

"Yeah, she was listed. One of the Asnas twins, a pair of mutant sisters who went insane."
