Ido sat down in a chair, reflecting. “Gally... you were so fixated on being a Hunter, on fighting, so why now?” Could it be that Gally is hiding something from me? As this thought crossed his mind, he felt something dark stir deep within him, causing a faint tremor. It was a black emotion, akin to jealousy. “My Gally...” Ido muttered, lowering his head over the table.

Meanwhile, Gally was walking down the bustling main street in the early afternoon, surrounded by crowds of people. “Wow… it's so lively during the day,” she remarked. The people filling the streets during the day were mostly workers and shoppers, creating a comparatively bright and lively atmosphere. However, that didn’t mean the junkies or collapsed homeless had disappeared, and in some corners of the street, drug deals and shady dealings were happening out in the open, even in broad daylight. The atmosphere, while vibrant, still carried hints of its rough edges.
