"You're not going again tonight? Have you already given up being a Hunter?" That afternoon, Ido once again invited Gally to join him in hunting down bounty heads, but, just like the last time, she hesitated and declined to go with him.

"Well, it's not that... it's just... I guess I'm starting to wonder why I always have to go with you, Ido," Gally replied, her full lips pouting slightly as she spoke.

To that, Ido teased her, "That's because your way of fighting isn't exactly top-notch. You keep fighting like you did against Colt every time."
