The man ran aimlessly through the alley, which would alternately widen and narrow. Whenever a side path branched off, he turned his head like a starving stray dog, hesitated for a moment, and then dashed into one of the alleys as if he had made up his mind.

"I'm gonna get killed! I'm gonna be melted!"
The man was terrified by illusions.
In his tear-filled eyes, the alley twisted grotesquely like the red and black intestines of a beast, swallowing him whole and pulling him deeper. There was no turning back now. Without stopping, he plunged further into the depths of the alley, convinced that it would devour and digest everything without a trace. He knew that, at this moment, if his brain were shaken, alkaloids would seep out like fruit juice.
It was a bad trip, caused by drug withdrawal.
Ah, the footsteps are getting closer.
They’re coming to melt me down.
The footsteps are getting closer.
They’re coming to melt me.
