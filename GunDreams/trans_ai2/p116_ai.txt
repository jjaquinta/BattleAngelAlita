"Calico squinted her eyes, trying to discern the hazy distance, but in this narrow space between buildings where neither streetlights nor neon lights reached, she could see at most ten meters ahead.

"Was it just her imagination? No.

The rumble of thunder shook every corner of the alley. At that moment, thunderclouds that had suddenly gathered overhead began pouring heavy rain upon Calico with a deafening sound.

Calico chose not to ignore that unknown presence. Releasing her hand from the doorknob, she focused her sharpened senses into the depths of the alley's darkness, paying no mind to the pounding rain.

Though the sound was drowned out by the rain and the figure was hidden in the darkness, Calico's beast-like keen senses surely detected the approaching presence. She wasn't certain whether it was dangerous, but a strange unease sounded an alarm in her heart.

Keeping her gaze fixed into the depths of the darkness, Calico lifted the hem of her wet and heavy coat, revealing a steel gun that gave off a dull shine in the rain. As she slowly pulled the bolt lever on the rear part of the machine, with a heavy operating sound, a used battery cartridge was ejected from the ejection port."
