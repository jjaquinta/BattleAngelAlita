"No... I don't want to... stop!"
Gally's eyes opened as wide as they could, and Shig lifted her lips into a cruel smile. Then, in one swift motion, she brought the blade of the knife down.
The cold, sharp tip of the knife closed in on Gally's forehead. Gally's mind convulsed in terror at the thought of death, and she let out a scream.
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die yet!
The moment her consciousness sparked and melted into the white-hot light, it came.
Gally's eyes took on the sharpness of a feline predator, emitting an intense light, and just as Shig swung the knife down with all her might, Gally struck it from both sides, causing the blade to explode and scatter.
"Hii... hiiii!"
