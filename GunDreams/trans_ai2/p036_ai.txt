As Ido continued to read through the data being displayed one after another, a look of astonishment gradually spread across his face. “I knew it. I can't believe a preservation method like this actually exists,” Ido muttered, trembling at the realization. Could this state be described as "ambient cold sleep"?

What was truly astonishing was that the brain stored within the skull of this decaying girl had been plastinated while still alive and preserved in a frozen state. Naturally, the brain's functions had completely stopped since the tissue had been plastinated. However, the fact that it had managed to maintain its structure for hundreds of years, despite the ravages of time and weather, was remarkable.

Who had performed such a unique preservation process on this girl's brain, and for what purpose? It was hard to believe that the girl herself had undergone this procedure on her own. Someone must have treated her for some reason, and then, after completing the procedure, discarded her among the waste in the scrapyard.

While Ido could only speculate, he felt a certain confidence that he wasn't far from the truth.
