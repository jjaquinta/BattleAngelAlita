CHAPTER 3

The underside of the massive ivory-colored pillar that held the floating city of Zalem hung like an elegantly curved bell-shaped slope, reminiscent of a wine glass. However, the beautiful bell’s tip was grotesquely broken, as if gnawed by a beast, and from it, waste was spewing down to the earth below, like dirty blood.Waste was being dumped continuously. "Ah, it’s already past noon," Ido muttered as a distant rumble and vibration reached the street where he stood. The waste spewing from Zalem accumulated on the surface, forming a massive slag heap over a thousand meters high at the center of The Scrapyard. When new waste crashed onto the peak of that heap, the impact caused tremors and the distant rumbling sound.

In The Scrapyard, this periodic sound of waste falling from Zalem was used as a kind of time marker. The distant rumble near noon became a signal for ending work early, a practice known as "half-day." Ido, knowing this custom, used the rumble to estimate the time.

"Hey, Gally, come over here," Ido called out. Gally, sitting in a wheelchair, gave him a slightly anxious look. She appeared completely transformed now. Her machine limbs were fully equipped, and her body’s exterior had been repaired with a youthful, feminine silhouette.

It had only been a few days since Ido had obtained the parts for Gally’s legs, and that morning had been spent attaching them.She had been practicing diligently for this moment. "Okay, I’m coming," Gally said, putting strength into her machine arms. She pressed down on the wheelchair's armrests, lifting her body up. 

"That's it, you can do it, Gally!" Ido cheered, his fists clenched in excitement. As Gally hesitantly tried to take her first step, Ido instinctively took a step forward as well. Gally carefully lowered one foot to the ground, as if testing the surface of water, while holding onto the back of the wheelchair. Then, she slowly placed her other foot down. 

"I... Ido..." Gally’s face reflected both fear and determination as she hesitantly reached out a hand toward Ido and began walking slowly. Seeing her, Ido broke into a wide smile, unable to contain himself. He stepped toward Gally, whose movements were still slightly awkward, and embraced her tightly."Ah, I’m so relieved. It looks like my body still remembers how to walk. Hey, Ido, does this mean I've finally become a proper person?" Gally asked, looking up at Ido's face. Just weeks ago, she had been nothing more than a piece of scrap buried in the junkyard, and now she stood before Ido, smiling with the joy of walking.

"Getting your body back together is just the starting point of your life. You have to keep living from here on," Ido said.

"Keep living...? Yeah, you're right," Gally repeated, as if reflecting on Ido’s words. Right now, Gally was alive thanks to Ido. Perhaps she was even living for Ido at this moment. If Ido hadn’t found her, Gally would have never had a life at all. Yet, she wasn’t sure if this was truly her own life. 

As she gained control over her body, a vague sense of questioning began to stir within Gally’s heart. Now, she would have to search for what it truly meant to live.When Gally naturally walked over, balancing a tray with a water jug, Gonzu was just getting up from the living room table.

"Oh, Gonzu, are you leaving already?" Gally asked.

Gonzu, quite drunk and swaying a little, nodded with his wrinkled, flushed face. "Yeah, if I drink any more here, I’ll end up staying over. I'll continue at my apartment."

"I don’t mind if you stay, Gonzu," Ido said, resting his elbow on the table, having lightly shared some drinks with Gonzu. But Gonzu laughed and shook his head.

"Heh, I know well enough that you don't like that sort of thing. Don't worry about it. See you later."

After Gally saw off the drunken Gonzu as he staggered out, she returned to the living room to find Ido stretching out with a big yawn."I'm tired today. And with the drink in me... I think I'll head to bed early tonight," Ido said as he stood up from the chair in the living room. Gally tugged at the hem of Ido's jacket and looked up at him with pleading eyes.

"Hey, Ido, are you really going to sleep already? Is the story about the outside world over for today?"

Ever since Gally had gained the ability to move freely, she had been eager to hear various stories from Ido, especially about the outside world. Her curiosity about The Scrapyard was particularly strong, and even the smallest tidbit would make her perk up and listen intently. Since she'd only taken a short walk around the clinic, even the most ordinary stories about the town seemed like grand adventures to her.

"Yeah, sorry, but let's call it a night. I'm really busy right now, but in a couple of days, I'll take you to the lively streets. So, for tonight, try not to stay up too late and get some rest," Ido said as he sluggishly left the living room.

No matter how much Gally puffed her cheeks in dissatisfaction, she had no choice but to return to her room and go to bed. 

"Closing my eyes and having another day end... it feels kind of boring," she muttered to herself.Gally dimmed the lights in her room and slipped under the bed covers, but she couldn’t fall asleep right away. About two hours later, as she was finally on the verge of drifting off after wrestling with her restless mind, she heard a sound. It was small, but oddly vivid, and it knocked on the door of Gally's consciousness. 

What could that be, at this hour? As her mind began to clear, Gally realized the sharp, rhythmic sound she was hearing was the sound of shoes tapping against the floor. She opened her eyes slightly in the dim room, which was illuminated surprisingly well by the moonlight. 

Slowly, she sat up in bed and listened carefully. The sound of footsteps passed by her room and descended the stairs. After a short while, she faintly heard the door to the clinic open and close. 

Gally slipped out of bed and quietly walked over to the curtained window. Gently lifting the edge of the curtain, she peeked outside. From the dim light, she saw a figure leaving the clinic and heading out into the street.She saw him. He was dragging a large trunk case beside him. It was a side of Ido that Gally had never seen before. The thought of Ido going into town without her knowing lit a spark of curiosity deep in Gally's heart. As her artificial heart throbbed rhythmically, that spark quickly spread, igniting an uncontrollable flame. 

"Where could he be going...?" 

Though she felt a bit of fear toward the unknown night streets, it wasn’t enough to stop the growing curiosity inside her. "What could he be doing, keeping it a secret from me?" 

With that thought, Gally bolted out of her room and out of the clinic. She dashed into the night, chasing after Ido’s disappearing figure, dressed in black, as he vanished into the shadows of The Scrapyard.

The pleasure district of the eastern part of The Scrapyard. At night, it transformed into a dazzling paradise, bathed in garish neon lights that were as bright as heaven and as poisonous as hell.It was a sleepless city. Sex, violence, drugs, and fraud were all commonplace here, freely rampant without regulation. Homeless people huddled around burning oil drums for warmth, while others sprawled across the street, staring blankly at the monitors as though their souls had been sucked out. The screens displayed cybernetic fighters in intense combat, and excited onlookers started placing bets on the sidewalk. 

Nearby, a prostitute who had been laughing suddenly went into a bad trip from a cocktail of drugs, screaming in agony. As she collapsed, foaming at the mouth, a group of men in white coats, looking like doctors, appeared from nowhere, swiftly gathering her up and carrying her off somewhere. A fellow prostitute who had witnessed the whole thing simply shrugged and did nothing.

People in the streets, seeing all this unfold, either laughed or cried at their own whims, without a care in the world, passing by without concern.

"This is too much for me..." Gally felt dizzy from the overwhelming sensory overload of bright colors and stimulation in the pleasure district. She felt as though if she stayed any longer, she might pass out from the sheer intensity."Ah, Ido, where are you really going?" Gally clutched her head in frustration as she desperately pushed through the crowd, trying to catch up with Ido. Although Gally’s small frame was almost swallowed by the crowd, Ido’s tall figure made him easy to spot. All Gally had to do was keep her eyes on the black, Adamski-style hat that floated above the crowd.

Unaware that Gally was chasing after him, Ido paused two or three times to check the street before suddenly slipping into a narrow alley. 

"Oh no!" Gally pushed her way through the throng, determined to reach the alley Ido had disappeared into. She forcefully nudged aside a few people, trying to cut her way through the crowd.

"Ow! Ouch!" At that very moment, Gally slammed into an unexpected wall, the impact knocking her back and sending her crashing down onto her rear.

"Well, well... seems like Baby’s hammerhead is pretty tough!"As Gally rubbed her nose and looked up, there stood a full-body cyborg with the head of a steel bull. The moment Gally tried to slip past him, the bull-headed cyborg intentionally thrust his chest forward.

"Uh... I-I'm sorry."

"Oh, sorry doesn't cut it, little baby! You almost made my delicate heart burst from that impact!"

The bull-headed cyborg pressed his steel chest with both arms and spoke in an exaggerated, angry tone, breathing heavily through his nose. Gally, caught off guard, could do nothing but sit there in confusion.

"Hey, baby, what should I do with you now?" The bull-headed cyborg cracked his knuckles menacingly as he stepped closer, causing Gally to slowly back away. Her entire body trembled in fear, and she frantically looked around for help. S-someone... anyone...

But none of the bystanders who had witnessed the situation made any move to help her. Some averted their eyes, some walked away disinterestedly, and others even smirked with careless curiosity.Everyone was just watching Gally’s panicked face. Not a single person came to her aid. *I’m all alone…* In her cornered state, she felt the weight of that realization settle in, along with a deep sense of despair. Even her only ally, Ido, wasn’t there to help her now.

“I’m gonna smash that scared little face of yours with my hammer blow! That’ll finally fix the pain in my heart!” 

The bull-headed cyborg thrust out his literal iron fist, which was about the same size as Gally's head. 

“Prepare yourself, baby! Heavenly knock-out punch!”

From his right-side stance, the bull-headed cyborg stepped forward with his right foot, using the momentum to drive his entire right arm and shoulder into a full-powered punch. The surprisingly solid straight punch from the joking bull-headed cyborg was aimed right at Gally’s crouched face.

"Uwaaaaahhh!"At that moment, Gally screamed in fear and ducked low, bending her body forward to slip under the bull-headed cyborg’s downward punch. As the fist whizzed past, the wind pressure ripped several strands of hair from her head, and Gally dashed through the opening, sliding past under his armpit.

"F***!"

The bull-headed cyborg's straight punch missed Gally and instead smashed into a nearby cyborg who was unlucky enough to be passing by.

"Guhee!"

The unfortunate cyborg was struck in the side and bent over in pain, collapsing like a folding chair. A sickening crack echoed as the cyborg's artificial spine snapped, sending spinal fluid splattering everywhere.

“Sh*t, that baby got away!” 

By the time the bull-headed cyborg turned back with an angry snort, Gally had already disappeared into the crowd.

“Hey, hey, little miss! Wait up! Come over here!” 

Gally was still frantically fleeing from the bull-headed cyborg, weaving through the throng of people as she ran for her life.As Gally darted through the crowd, a soft voice unexpectedly called out to her. She hesitated for a moment before stopping and turning toward the source of the voice. There, she saw a plump woman standing still, waving her hand with a smile. Her face was thickly covered in bright makeup, giving her a charming, raccoon-like appearance.

"Um, are you... an old lady?" Gally asked the woman, but she didn’t answer. Instead, she gently grabbed Gally’s hand and pulled her into a narrow alley. It was the backside of the entertainment district, a filthy, dimly lit alley strewn with garbage.

"For now, you’ll be safe here for a bit. No one will find you," the woman said. "I'm just a lowly prostitute named Shigu. What about you, honey?"

"Uh... Gally," she replied.

It seemed Shigu had seen everything—how Gally had been hassled by the bull-headed cyborg. That man, known as Colt, was the leader of a gang of thugs in the area, notorious for causing trouble. While he wasn’t officially a wanted man, rumors said he had already killed a few people in the shadows."Someone like you wandering around there in the middle of the night is bound to get preyed on," Shigu sighed, leaning against the dirty wall. "Honestly, it’s just dangerous."

"I lost sight of Ido... and then that guy, he purposely bumped into me! I didn’t know what was going on and panicked... damn it!" Gally ground her teeth in frustration, her shoulders trembling with anger. 

Shigu let out a small laugh, surprised by Gally’s unexpected show of strength. "You’re a funny one, Gally. Really funny... Makes me glad I helped you, for real."

But just then, Gally felt a chilling shift in Shigu’s soft tone, as if something more dangerous was lurking behind her words. 

"Huh?" Gally looked up at Shigu, and saw that her eyes, fixed on Gally, had grown cold and half-lidded with a sinister gaze.

"Uh, Shigu... what’s wrong?" Gally asked, confused, taking a cautious step backward."Hah... oh no..." Gally had no escape. Before she knew it, several women, likely Shigu's associates, had emerged from the shadows on both sides of the alley, surrounding her. 

"You’re too kind, aren’t you? I didn’t save you for free, you know. It’s time you accept your fate and behave... hey," Shigu ordered, nodding her chin. 

One of the women pushed Gally against the wall and pressed a knife against her neck. 

"What do you plan to do to me?" Gally demanded, but the women ignored her. Instead, they rolled up her sleeves, inspecting her arms and legs.

"Shigu, no doubt about it. This girl’s arm... it's from the missing Stea."

"And her legs? They’re from that notorious killer."

The women murmured among themselves, all eyes turning to Shigu. Shigu let out a low growl, glaring at Gally with an intense expression that bore none of the warmth or playfulness she had shown before."Those arms and legs of yours... they're all from our fellow prostitutes who either died or went missing. Gally, where and how did you get those limbs?"

"When you say where, my whole body was fixed by Ido!" Gally replied, to which Shigu and the others repeated the name "Ido" in unison. Their voices were filled with deep anger.

"So it was that Ido guy who cut up Stea?"

"And Walza too."

"Uji was also killed..."

Overwhelmed by the rising bloodlust of the prostitutes, Gally felt a dull numbness creep into her head. 

What are these people even saying?

"There's been a serial killer prowling around here lately. Us prostitutes have been hit the hardest, losing many of our sisters to that murderer. We were just about to figure out how to deal with the bastard, and then you show up wearing parts from one of our victims."Shigu said this as she pulled out a knife from her pocket. The blade of the knife emitted a dark metallic sheen, almost reminiscent of reptile skin. Shigu licked the blade and then slowly advanced toward Gally.

"So, this Ido guy is a damn serial killer, isn't he, Gally?"

"No, Ido would never—you're wrong! You're all wrong! I don't understand what you're saying!" Gally shook her head violently as she spoke. A chill ran down her spine, and despite gasping for breath, her mind felt oxygen-deprived, as if her artificial lungs were malfunctioning, causing her vision to blur.

"We're going to find that Ido bastard and make him pay. I've already spent a fortune to hire a top-class Hunter for that. Gally, you're just the right offering. We'll tear you apart as a message to him," Shigu declared.

The blade in Shigu's raised hand caught a faint glimmer of light, reflecting Gally's terror-stricken face like a mirror.

"Time to die, Gally.""No... no, stop it!" Gally's eyes widened as far as they could go. Sig's lips curled into a cruel smile, and without hesitation, she swung the knife down with full force. The cold, sharp tip of the blade came dangerously close to Gally's forehead. Frozen in fear, Gally couldn't tear her eyes away from the sight. Her mind screamed as the terror of death paralyzed her.

"I don't want to die... not yet!" Her thoughts sparked and blurred into a white-hot flash, and in that moment, something inside Gally snapped with a sharp *crack*. 

"Fuuuu... Ooooooh!" Gally's eyes suddenly gleamed with the fierce sharpness of a wild feline, glowing with intense light. As Sig brought down the knife with all her might, Gally reacted with instinctive precision, catching the blade between her fists just before it reached her forehead. 

With a loud *snap*, the knife shattered and scattered into pieces. 

"H-hiiiii!" Sig let out a terrified, shrill cry, shocked by the sudden surge of energy from Gally.Sig let out a short, sharp cry as she was caught in the blast of heat that suddenly emanated from Gally. It was as if a small girl had been caught in the gaze of a man-eating tiger suddenly appearing from the shadows. Sig staggered back, her legs giving way, and she collapsed onto the filthy street. The sound of her teeth chattering filled the air, and a foul stench of urine mixed with the smell of the alley as a dark stain slowly spread from where she sat. 

"Fuuuu..." Gally stood still, swaying slightly, as she slowly scanned the faces of Sig's companions. The other prostitutes were already frozen in fear, as though they had been turned into frogs under the gaze of a snake. They dropped their knives, trembling, their legs giving way as they hurriedly pulled Sig along and fled the alley. 

Left alone in the dim alley, Gally stood quietly, unmoving. "What... what is this feeling?" Gally whispered, trying to stop the trembling that was spreading throughout her body by hugging herself tightly. It was as if she was being driven by a surge of past memories. Gally had shattered the knife with a swift movement, but now she was left standing in the darkness, shaken by something deep within her.She had used a technique. The surge of violent impulses and the pride in the skills she possessed arose instantly. Though it felt distant from her current self, there was a deep familiarity with the memory of battle. All of these thoughts filled Gally's mind, overwhelming her to the point where the intensity made her brain feel like it was heating up, ready to boil over. *To think that discovering just a fragment of who I once was would feel this intense...* Gally was caught between awe and confusion as waves of fear and joy surged through her heart. 

Before she could calm her rising emotions, a sharp, blade-like killing intent closed in on her from behind. "That's some impressive skill, young lady," came a chilling voice, as the aura of impending violence crept over Gally like a shroud. Freezing in terror, Gally instinctively threw herself forward, rolling to gain distance before turning to face her attacker.

"You...!" Gally's entire body tingled with an electrifying sensation, as if her skin was bristling from an unseen threat. She narrowed her gaze, locking onto the figure who had just tried to kick her. But the figure, strangely calm, had no trace of killing intent, staring back at Gally with a somewhat vacant expression.The woman lowered her guard and said, "Oh, my, such a fierce little lady you've turned out to be. Even if I wasn’t serious, dodging that kick is no small feat, huh?" She scratched at her pineapple-shaped red hair with her fingers, twisting her plump red lips into a smirk. Her tall figure, wrapped in a sleek leather coat, was just like Gally’s—made entirely of steel and ceramic, a machine body.

"Who the hell are you?" Gally asked cautiously, trying to assert dominance over the red-haired woman. Inside, however, she was still reeling from the kick and the brief flash of killing intent the woman had unleashed, her whole body trembling with fear. She clenched her teeth, desperately trying to hide her inner turmoil, not wanting to reveal her anxiety to this intimidating redhead.

*Fragments of memories of battles are just starting to wake up deep within me... But I still have no idea how strong those memories truly are.* Gally doubted whether the uncertain fighting skills she was only beginning to recall would be of any use against this dangerous woman before her.

The redhead grinned and responded, "Me? I was hired by a certain someone. My job is to track down and kill that serial killer who's been targeting prostitutes.""But, once the client sinks their teeth into a lead, I can't just stay silent, you know?" The red-haired woman spoke as Gally tensed up, a shudder running through her body that was unmistakably visible to the woman. *This skilled fighter is after Ido?* 

"Even if Ido is a killer, there’s no way I’ll let him be taken down!" Gally screamed as she suddenly dashed toward the red-haired woman, aiming to close the gap.

"Huh? Ido?" The redhead’s eyes widened behind her glasses at Gally’s mention of Ido. That momentary surprise caused her defense to falter for just a fraction of a second, and in that instant, Gally’s spinning attack struck. The red-haired woman couldn’t fully block the force, and she tumbled backward.

"Here I come! Prepare yourself!" Gally, sensing her chance, charged forward as the redhead tried to rise, launching a high kick aimed at her. The force of the kick tore through the air with a sharp whistle, like a high-pitched sound.

A sharp "clink" rang out as sparks briefly flickered in the dim alley.The one who was sent flying was none other than Gally. Her high-speed kick had been countered by the red-haired woman with an equally powerful kick. Due to Gally's smaller frame and the fact that the red-haired woman had precisely aimed at the less powerful base of Gally’s leg, Gally lost her balance and spiraled into the wall with a crash.

“...Ugh…” Gally’s head slammed hard against the wall, leaving her dazed and disoriented. As her vision blurred, the red-haired woman calmly approached and knelt down, lifting Gally up as she slumped against the wall.

“You said *Ido*, didn’t you? Could it be… are you Ido's daughter or something?” the red-haired woman asked.

Gally winced through the fog in her mind and weakly shook her head. “No... I was saved by Ido. He’s my savior... He wouldn’t harm anyone.”

The red-haired woman silently observed Gally's face for a while, then let out a deep sigh as she stood up. Gally, seeing this, slowly closed her eyes as her consciousness began to fade. *She's terrifyingly strong... this woman...*"Ido... please don't get caught by this woman..." In her fading consciousness, Gally braced herself for the red-haired woman to finish her off.
