Ido sensitively picked up on Gally’s awkward attempt to smooth things over, but he decided to let it rest for now. He didn't want to let his emotions get the best of him. However, the feelings he held back found no outlet and sank deep in his gut like sediment. Gally also sensed some tension between herself and Ido, which pained her, but she convinced herself that there was nothing she could do to stop the overwhelming urge that drove her.

That night, Gally finally resolved to confess her troubled thoughts to Ido. Ido, in surprise, slammed the table and stood up.  
“Why... why are you suddenly talking about being a Hunter Warrior? This is nonsense! Gally, how could you ever become a Hunter Warrior?”  
Gally, her cheeks slightly flushed, looked at Ido with a mix of determination and vulnerability.  
“I’ve started to remember... I remember that I used to know the art of combat. And by putting myself in battle, little by little, I can reclaim those skills as my own.”  
Ido shook his head, cutting her off with firm resolve.
