To return to the city of those who survive by feeding on the scrap of past centuries — The Scrapyard.

Ido Daisuke’s cybernetic clinic in The Scrapyard was located in a relatively quiet residential area, nestled within a corner of a mixed-use building on Tempest Street, in the eastern district of the city.

By the time Ido finally reached his home, the sun had set, and night had already fallen. Still carrying the girl's body, he hurried directly to the operating room.

As he walked through the room, the ventilator wheezed like it had caught a cold, and one by one, the lamps flickered on. The machinery cast colorful reflections on the dimly lit ceiling and the pipes, creating a complex sheen reminiscent of the wall’s surface.

The girl, now hooked up to a monitor showing the erratic signals from her half-destroyed liver, was surrounded by countless cables of various sizes and lengths. The waves of light made her seem like a doll captured by some dark entity. Ido alternated between scanning the girl's head and observing the data, trying to decipher its meaning.
