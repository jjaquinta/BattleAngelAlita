"But, once the client sinks their teeth into a lead, I can't just stay silent, you know?" The red-haired woman spoke as Gally tensed up, a shudder running through her body that was unmistakably visible to the woman. *This skilled fighter is after Ido?* 

"Even if Ido is a killer, there’s no way I’ll let him be taken down!" Gally screamed as she suddenly dashed toward the red-haired woman, aiming to close the gap.

"Huh? Ido?" The redhead’s eyes widened behind her glasses at Gally’s mention of Ido. That momentary surprise caused her defense to falter for just a fraction of a second, and in that instant, Gally’s spinning attack struck. The red-haired woman couldn’t fully block the force, and she tumbled backward.

"Here I come! Prepare yourself!" Gally, sensing her chance, charged forward as the redhead tried to rise, launching a high kick aimed at her. The force of the kick tore through the air with a sharp whistle, like a high-pitched sound.

A sharp "clink" rang out as sparks briefly flickered in the dim alley.
