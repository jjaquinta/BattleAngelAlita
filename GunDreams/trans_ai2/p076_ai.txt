As Ido lifted the head of the hammer, using the acceleration and centrifugal force to his advantage, he mercilessly swung the hammer's tip into the woman's temple. "Ah... so Ido *is* the serial killer," Gally muttered, overwhelmed by the brutal reality in front of her, unable to avert her eyes. Below, Ido stood, gazing down at the head of the woman now crushed into the hammer. Her head had been obliterated by the force of the blow, making it impossible to even recognize it as once being human. Ido let out a faint smile, stepping on the flattened remains to pull them free from the hammerhead. Then, he carefully placed the crushed head into a burlap sack he was holding.

"Hehe... shocked, aren't you?" whispered the red-haired woman who had crouched down beside Gally, speaking softly into her ear. Gally sat there, dazed and frozen. Seeing this, the red-haired woman smiled broadly at first, but as Gally remained unresponsive, she sighed. 

"Oh dear... she's completely out of it. Maybe I went a little too far with the fun, huh?"
