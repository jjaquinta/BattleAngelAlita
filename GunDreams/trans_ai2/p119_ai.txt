Shig had likely dragged her ruined body all the way here, desperate to reach Calico. At the sound of her strangled voice, it seemed to trigger the last of her strength, and she collapsed slowly, sliding down into the blood-soaked alleyway, leaning against the wall. 

As Calico prepared to move toward the falling Shig, a strange, grinding noise emerged from the darkness behind her, distinct even over the torrential rain. Calico's eyes flared with anger as she glared into the gloom behind Shig. The narrow alley was filled with nothing but darkness, the source of the eerie grinding noise barely noticeable, hiding itself in the shadows.

Calico, crouched and ready for any attack, subtly shifted her stance. She adjusted her weight slightly, moving it from her back foot to the ball of her front foot. By leaning her weight slightly forward, she sacrificed some of her linear movement but gained the ability to initiate her attack much faster. Though her face remained focused, she concealed her rising anxiety beneath a mask of calm readiness.
