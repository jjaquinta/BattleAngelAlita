# CHAPTER 4

“Hey... come on, wake up already.”

A distant voice, soft at first, pierced through the fog of Gally's unconscious mind, dragging her back to reality. When she opened her eyes, the red-haired woman—Calico—was staring down at her with an unsettling smile. Gally had been unconscious for several minutes, completely unaware of her surroundings.

“Where... am I?” Gally murmured, her voice weak.

She found herself on the rooftop of a building, the cold metal beneath her unfamiliar. Calico had carried her up here. The night sky stretched above, stars obscured by the thick pollution of **The Scrapyard**. 

Calico stood near the edge of the roof, her silhouette framed against the night sky. There were no fences, no barriers—just a steep drop to the streets below. She gazed downward, then tilted her head slightly, motioning with her chin.

“Take a look. It’s quite a sight, don’t you think?”

Reluctantly, Gally crawled over to the edge and peeked down. 

*Ido...*

Far below, in a small intersection of shadowed alleyways, Ido stood. Dressed in his familiar black attire, he was leaning against the corner of a building, his posture tense, almost predatory. Beside him was the same large trunk Gally had seen earlier, the one he'd taken when he left the clinic. 

In his hands, Ido gripped a massive hammer. The weapon gleamed faintly in the moonlight, its sharp, pointed tip designed not for labor but for violence.

Gally's breath hitched. “What is Ido planning to do?” she whispered, her heart racing.

Before Calico could respond, faint footsteps echoed through the alley. A figure emerged—a woman, walking slowly, unaware of the danger lurking ahead. Ido pressed himself closer to the wall, silent and unseen.

The red-haired woman beside Gally smiled, enjoying the tension in the air.

Suddenly, as the woman passed, Ido moved. His hammer swung upward in a smooth, practiced arc, and the sound that followed—an awful, crunching impact—echoed up to the rooftop.

“No!” Gally gasped, her voice barely more than a breath. 

The hammer connected with the woman’s skull, and she crumpled to the ground, lifeless. The sound of her death was sickening, the crunch of bone and flesh shattered by the force of Ido’s swing.

For a moment, Gally froze, unable to process the brutality before her. Below, Ido calmly stepped forward, placing his foot on the woman’s head and pulling the hammer free from her crushed remains. Then, with practiced precision, he lowered her head into a burlap sack.

“A-ah...” Gally choked on her breath.

Beside her, Calico crouched down, her voice a low whisper. “Shocked, aren’t you?”

Gally remained still, her mind reeling from the sight of Ido’s cold efficiency. She had never imagined this. The man who had saved her, the man who had given her life, was... a killer?

Calico, noticing Gally's vacant expression, let out a sigh. “Oh dear... maybe I went a little too far with the fun.”

She gave Gally a light shake, slapping her cheeks gently to bring her back. “Come on, snap out of it. That was nothing, you know. It’s just part of the job.”

Slowly, Gally’s eyes regained focus. She shook her head, trying to dispel the numbness clouding her mind. 

“What... what is Ido doing?” she whispered, her voice barely audible.

Calico leaned back, a grin tugging at her lips. “Ido isn’t a serial killer. He’s a Hunter—one who hunts down the killers.”

---

The red-haired woman explained the truth behind Ido’s actions. In **The Scrapyard**, there was no formal law, no police to protect the people. Instead, the Factory, which controlled the city on behalf of **Zalem**, maintained order by placing bounties on criminals. These criminals were hunted by freelance bounty hunters—known as **Hunter-Warriors**.

“The woman Ido just killed was on the list,” Calico said casually, handing Gally a printout of the bounty.

Gally scanned the page, her heart still racing. The woman’s name was Asnas—one of the notorious mutant sisters who had committed multiple murders. The bounty for her head was 32,000 chips.

Gally let out a long, shaky breath. “So... Ido’s been doing this to keep us alive. To repair me.”

Calico nodded, lighting a cigarette and exhaling a cloud of purple smoke. “Yep. He’s one of the decent ones, though. Doesn’t take bodyguard gigs like I do. He just hunts the small fry. Probably to help you out.”

Gally looked down again at the alley, where Ido was now packing up the remains of his target. The knowledge weighed heavily on her, but alongside the shock was a growing realization: Ido was doing this to protect her. Every strike of his hammer, every head he collected, was a sacrifice to restore her body.

---

They sat in silence for a moment before Calico broke it, her tone lighter. “By the way, where did you learn that technique back there?”

Gally frowned, her memories still a blur. “I... don’t know. Ido brought me back to life, but I have no idea who I used to be.”

The martial arts that had surged up during her earlier fight had felt instinctive, yet distant—like fragments of a forgotten life. Gally’s mind was still foggy, her past submerged beneath layers of uncertainty.

“Hey, do you think we’ll meet again?” Gally asked suddenly, looking over at Calico.

The red-haired woman scratched her head, flicking her cigarette away. Without a word, she stood and disappeared into the shadows of the entertainment district.

---

Gally made it home before Ido returned. He must have gone to the Factory to cash in the bounty, which gave her just enough time to slip back into the clinic. But even as she lay in bed, the events of the night replayed in her mind.

The next morning, Ido noticed the scratches and dents on Gally’s body as he performed maintenance. His concern was evident. 

“What happened, Gally? There’s some misalignment in your joints... did you trip or something?”

Gally forced a smile. “It’s nothing, Ido. Just... had a rough night.”

But inside, she couldn’t stop thinking about the battle with Calico, the rush of combat, the fleeting memories that had surfaced. She had to know more.

That evening, she finally worked up the courage to confront Ido.

“I want to become a Hunter-Warrior,” Gally announced, her voice firm.

Ido froze, his expression shifting from shock to disbelief. “What? Gally... no. Why would you want to do something like that?”

Gally’s heart pounded, but she held her ground. “I’ve started to remember, Ido. Combat techniques... they’re coming back to me. I need to find out who I am, and I think I can do that by fighting.”

Ido shook his head, turning away from her. “That’s not why I saved you. I didn’t pull you from the scrapyard to see you fight.”

Gally’s voice trembled. “Ido, I *know* you’re a Hunter-Warrior. You’ve been doing this... for me. But I don’t want you to face all this alone. I want to help you.”

Ido’s shoulders tensed, his voice barely a whisper. “I do this for you, Gally. Because I want to protect you. You don’t belong in this world.”

Tears welled up in Gally’s eyes. “But it’s *my* life, Ido. I need to live it my way.”

Ido didn’t turn. His voice cracked with emotion. “I wanted to make you into something beautiful, Gally. Not... this.”

“I’m sorry, Ido,” she whispered, turning to leave. “But I can’t be your dream.”

---

Wandering through the streets of the pleasure district, Gally felt lost. She didn’t know where to go, or how to become a Hunter-Warrior. She sat down on a pile of old monitors and sighed.

A hand rested on her shoulder.

“We meet again,” a familiar voice said.

Gally looked up to see Shig, the plump, tanuki-faced woman from the night before.

“Sorry about yesterday,” Shig said with a sheepish grin. “Didn’t know your friend was a Hunter.”

Gally smiled faintly, grateful for the small kindness. Without thinking, she hugged Shig.

“Thank you,” Gally whispered.

---

Shig led her to the back of one of The Scrapyard’s top cabarets, where Kyariko, the red-haired Hunter-Warrior, often worked. Gally’s heart raced as they entered the dimly lit hallway leading to a dressing room.

“Kyariko,” Shig called out, knocking loudly.

After a brief pause, the door opened, revealing the red-haired woman, cigarette in hand.

“So, you’ve come to bother me again?” Kyariko smirked, leaning against the doorframe.

“She wants to be a Hunter-Warrior,” Shig explained.

Kyariko sighed, rolling her

 eyes. “Fine. I’ll take you to the Factory.”

---

The Factory loomed in the distance, a massive structure beneath the floating city of Zalem. Pipes twisted upward, connecting to the heavens, while the ground level buzzed with activity. Inside, the process to become a Hunter-Warrior was simple—a laser imprinted an identification code onto Gally’s brain. 

“That’s it?” Gally asked, rubbing her forehead.

“Becoming one is easy,” Kyariko replied. “Making a name for yourself? That’s the hard part.”

As they left the Factory, a group of men stepped out from the shadows, surrounding them. Their leader, a fully cyberized thug with the head of a steel bull, stepped forward, cracking his knuckles.

“Remember me, baby?” Colt sneered, his eyes gleaming with malice.

Gally took a step forward, her gaze hardening. “Colt.”

The tension in the air thickened as the confrontation loomed.

---

The battle that followed was swift and brutal. Colt, a towering figure of strength, attacked relentlessly, his blows powerful and precise. But Gally, with her newly awakened instincts, met him head-on, her movements fluid and sharp.

Colt’s laughter echoed through the streets as he charged again and again, each strike more furious than the last. But Gally, though battered, refused to back down.

With a final, devastating kick, she leaped into the air, her body spinning like a whirlwind. The impact was instant—Colt’s head was crushed beneath her heels, his body torn apart by the sheer force of her attack.

The streets fell silent.

Gally stood amidst the wreckage, her chest heaving, her mind ablaze with the realization of what she had just done.

Calico watched from the shadows, her cigarette hanging loosely from her lips. “That... was ancient Martian combat,” she whispered, her voice tinged with awe.

Gally, trembling, whispered back. “I remember now.”

With that, she collapsed, the exhaustion of the battle finally overtaking her.
