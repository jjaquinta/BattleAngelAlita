CHAPTER 2

Around the perimeter of **The Scrapyard**, there were mounds of discarded waste in a ring-like formation. It was a desolate landscape of mountains of waste, remnants of the previous century, which had piled up over hundreds of years along with red rust, creating a high ridge across the surface. At first glance, it seemed like a dead world, but to this world, where everything had decayed and disappeared, it was a precious treasure trove of resources.

It was the season after October. Bathed in the light of the red setting sun that had melted into the horizon, a girl, half-buried in the desolate heaps of scrap, was now partially exposed on the surface. This was due to the work of the heavy machinery used for waste disposal, which had excavated her from the mounds that had buried her for so long.

In the deepest part, she had been lying dormant. Naturally, she was in a state of functional shutdown—a state of death. A long time had passed since the consciousness that once governed the body of the buried girl had departed into some void of nothingness. Hundreds of years had already passed since she had been buried here. The girl's body was a machine. Even after all this time, there was no dissonance in her lying amidst the sea of scrap, because her body was an artificial creation made of steel and ceramic.

"Aah... Ahhh... Wow!" When Ido Daisuke discovered the girl in the mountain of scrap, he slipped from the ledge in excitement and tumbled down several meters through the pile. There, amidst the scrap, an angel of machines was asleep. The joy of discovering something valuable among junk is something that will always excite any man. With the gleam of a boy in his eyes at this secret discovery, Ido eagerly ran back up the gentle slope and crouched beside the rust-covered girl. Her external appearance seemed to be about fifteen or sixteen years old. Though her hair was already gone, her soft, egg-shaped face...

Her face. Though her closed eyes weren't particularly long and narrow, they were rather large. Her nose was small but had a straight and defined bridge. Her mouth, although small, had full, plump lips both on the upper and lower parts, leaving a striking impression. She must have been a pretty girl. But it's surprising that her head remained undamaged. Ido let out a faint smile, gently touching the girl's cheek. The synthetic skin had inevitably weathered, and even a light touch caused fine cracks, like worn-out rubber, to appear.

Ido shifted his observation from the girl’s face to her body, searching for any functional discoveries. While she may not have been a high-end model, the girl's body, created with technology from centuries ago, must have been magnificent. It was easy to imagine that traces of advanced cyborg technology—far superior to the current, regressed techniques—would be present throughout her body. As a cyber-physician, Ido’s heart raced with excitement. 

However, he couldn’t make any concrete observations. When he dug out more of her body from the scrap, it became apparent that apart from her peaceful, sleeping-like expression, the rest of her body was critically damaged. Her arms were missing, as were her legs. Her torso below the chest was severely damaged, and most of her artificial organs and neural systems were destroyed.

Her artificial parts had also weathered, been damaged, or had fallen off. More than half of her artificial spine had been severed, and it was impossible to discern any functionality from it. At this point, there was nothing in this girl’s body that could satisfy Ido’s intellectual curiosity. The remains of this cyborg girl had already become nothing more than old junk. If only I had found her a hundred years earlier. Ido let out a light sigh and scratched his head. Then, standing up, he turned his back on the girl’s remains, ready to say goodbye. She was a cute girl. If the damage had been a little less severe, I could have brought her back and added her to my underground antique collection. 

Feeling a twinge of reluctance, Ido began descending the slope. After a few steps, he looked back again. The remains of the girl were still there, lying abandoned atop the heap of scrap, bathed in the orange glow of the setting sun. 

Why is it, I wonder... She's truly a strange one. Among the countless cyborg remains, this girl alone seemed strangely vivid.

Although Ido had already confirmed that the girl’s body was nothing more than junk, for some reason, he couldn’t shake the feeling that she wasn’t truly dead. Ido tried to rid himself of this uncharacteristically illogical thought and reaffirmed what he had already diagnosed with his own eyes. 

"The heart and lungs have long since stopped functioning. The liver is missing. The generator is gone, and the emergency battery is half-destroyed and completely useless. There’s nothing left inside this body that’s still working. The only part I haven’t checked is... her brain." 

As he muttered this, Ido suddenly had a thought—could her brain still be intact? But almost immediately, he scoffed at himself for such an idea and let out a sigh. It’s been at least a hundred years since this girl ceased to function. There’s no way her brain could still be preserved inside this dilapidated body, not unless it was kept in some kind of preservation unit. It’s just not possible. Not possible, but...

“Haha, that’s impossible,” Ido muttered, trying to deny the thought filling his mind, yet he found himself once again crouching beside the girl. Even in the sealed skull of a cyborg, the brain itself is a "living thing." There was no way it could have survived hundreds of years without decaying. Even if somehow it had remained, it would have either decomposed into liquid or turned to dust by now.

“I’m about to do something pointless,” Ido chuckled bitterly to himself as he gently lifted the girl’s body, cradling her lifeless head softly in his hands. 

Ido possessed medical knowledge and experience that far surpassed those of an ordinary cybernetic doctor. As a rare comprehensive physician in The Scrapyard, he was capable of diagnosing whether there was any movement of liquid or powder inside her head through careful palpation or percussion. With utmost care, Ido lifted the girl’s head and lightly tapped it from side to side.

It didn’t take long for Ido’s eyes to widen and his cheeks to flush with excitement. “No... this can’t be...”

“Haha... ha, haha! Even something absurd is worth believing in when you have a hunch about it!” Ido shouted to the sky, trembling. The girl’s head felt unexpectedly heavy. Moreover, no matter how much he shook it, the center of gravity within the girl’s head didn’t shift, as if it were like a hard-boiled egg. While he couldn’t understand the exact condition, this meant there was a possibility that the brain inside the girl’s skull had somehow been preserved.

“I’ve never heard of anything like this before. Could a human brain, which has been inactive for hundreds of years, really begin functioning again?” No... wait, back in that city... A memory flashed across Ido’s mind, and it quickly spurred him to make a decision. 

“It’s worth a shot!” he said. “I’ll take her to my clinic and attempt a revival operation.”

With renewed resolve, Ido hurried away from the scrapyard where the stars had just begun to twinkle, rushing back to his home, where the necessary equipment awaited.

In order to return to The Scrapyard, the city of those who live off the scraps of the previous century. Ido Daisuke's cybernetic clinic, located in The Scrapyard, was in a relatively quiet residential area in the east part of the city, on Tempest Street, inside a mixed-use building. By the time Ido finally arrived in front of his home, the sun had already set, and night had fallen. Still holding the girl’s body, Ido hurried straight to the operating room.

As he walked through the room, which was filled with the mechanical chill of clinical sterility, the machines came to life, almost as if by magic, one after another, lighting up their lamps. The multicolored lights reflected off the dim ceiling’s pipes, creating a complex sheen that resembled the texture of some glistening internal organ. 

The half-destroyed girl lay fixed on the operating table, covered in countless cables of various lengths and thicknesses. Surrounded by monitors displaying different waveforms, the girl’s figure, bathed in their glow, resembled a doll imprisoned by mechanical tentacles. 

Ido, doing his best to calm his pounding heart, alternated between looking at the scan images of the girl's head and the data, trying to understand what they meant.

As Ido continued to read through the data being displayed one after another, a look of astonishment gradually spread across his face. “I knew it. I can't believe a preservation method like this actually exists,” Ido muttered, trembling at the realization. Could this state be described as "ambient cold sleep"?

What was truly astonishing was that the brain stored within the skull of this decaying girl had been plastinated while still alive and preserved in a frozen state. Naturally, the brain's functions had completely stopped since the tissue had been plastinated. However, the fact that it had managed to maintain its structure for hundreds of years, despite the ravages of time and weather, was remarkable.

Who had performed such a unique preservation process on this girl's brain, and for what purpose? It was hard to believe that the girl herself had undergone this procedure on her own. Someone must have treated her for some reason, and then, after completing the procedure, discarded her among the waste in the scrapyard.

While Ido could only speculate, he felt a certain confidence that he wasn't far from the truth.

“The question now is whether I can successfully thaw her from this state,” Ido muttered to himself. He recalled once reading a clinical report from a file in a certain facility, which described a successful case of reversing plastination and reviving the tissue to its original state. He remembered that the report was part of a vast collection of medical data, and it was about a hundred years old.

"Who would've thought that the special knowledge from back then would come in handy now..." Ido touched the mark on his forehead with his finger. It was a symbol, a circle with the top part cut off in a square shape, an emblem from his homeland, engraved on him long ago.

With a sigh, Ido shook his head and refocused, moving swiftly around the operating room once again. It had been a full day since he brought the girl into the surgery room. He had not taken a single break, completely absorbed in working on her. Naturally, the Cyborgenics clinic had been closed for the day. Dressed in a wrinkled white coat, Ido sat beside the still-sleeping girl.

Aside from occasionally adjusting the equipment, Ido stared intently at the monitor. Several waveforms displayed on the screen reflected in his round glasses, their light tracing smooth, slow arcs. If the thawing process had gone well, she should be waking up soon.

As Ido let out the breath he'd been holding deep in his lungs, the door to the operating room creaked open with a dull sound.

"Hey, Ido! What's got you so worked up this time, huh?" The voice came from a man over fifty, shaking his large belly as he swaggered into the room with a bottle of liquor in hand. 

This man, named Gonzu, was one of the few friends Ido had. Gonzu, entirely human except for the iron plate riveted to his head like a manhole cover, filled the room with the pungent smell of alcohol as he entered. Ido wrinkled his nose slightly at the scent but continued typing on the keyboard connected to the monitor without turning around.

“Hey, Gonzu, look at this. It’s amazing, this girl.”

“What? It’s just some old kid's junk, isn’t it? You went and picked up more of this kind of stuff again?”

Gonzu let out a belch as he approached the girl fixed to the operating table, his face flushed red. To Gonzu and most ordinary people, she would indeed appear to be nothing more than junk. Half-destroyed, non-functional cyborgs were a common sight in The Scrapyard, often scattered along the streets. Though they wouldn’t last long before being picked up by dealers, dismantled, and recycled into something useful.

"Calling her junk is harsh. This girl is a proper human being," Ido said, showing the monitor to Gonzu. Gonzu rubbed his thick chin with a finger, blinking his droopy eyelids as he peered at the screen.

"Wait a minute... Are you telling me this old, busted-up heap is still functional?" Gonzu looked at Ido with genuine surprise.

Ido grinned with satisfaction and nodded. "After checking, I found that her brain had been inactive in the scrap heap for about 200 years. But someone took measures to preserve her brain tissue. And I managed to bring her brain back to life."

"Man... You're into some weird stuff, aren't you?" Gonzu muttered.

Gonzu wrinkled his aged, creased face and shrugged. "What are you going to do, waking up a girl from a dream in this bleak world? Isn’t this all a waste of time?" he muttered. As Ido smiled, gazing at the girl, Gonzu tipped back his bottle of cheap liquor, draining the last of it into his stomach. He sighed, the sound mingling with a belch.

It was around 7 PM on the third day after Ido began the resurrection process when the girl finally woke up. Gonzu, who had been napping, woke Ido, and the brainwave monitor indicated that the girl was in REM sleep. Ido, not wanting to miss the moment she awoke, stared intently at her face without even blinking.

Before long, the girl's eyelids slowly lifted, and Ido, his face beaming with joy, gently spoke to her. "Hey, I'm Ido Daisuke. What's your name?"

“Na…mae?” The girl, still groggy, cast a sleepy gaze at Ido but made no attempt to answer. She had completely lost her memory during her long period of inactivity. Ido didn’t look particularly concerned, smiling softly and shaking his head. 

“That’s okay, you’ll remember in time. Once we fix up your body and you gradually start experiencing the world outside,” he said, pausing for a moment before nodding at the girl, who was still staring at him with that dreamy expression.

“From today, your name will be Gally.” 

The girl, drawn in by Ido’s smile, smiled back. Having lost everything, she felt no discomfort or confusion, simply happy to accept the name Ido had given her. The name “Gally” came from a male cat Ido had owned and who had died the previous year. 

Five days passed since the girl had woken up and been given the name Gally.

"Is this... me?" Gally widened her large, dark eyes in genuine surprise as Ido held up the mirror he had brought from the sink, showing her reflection. Her straight, fine black hair had been neatly restored, and the damaged facial skin had been replaced with fresh, synthetic skin. When she had been found, Gally's face had been weathered and damaged in several places, but now it had been repaired to look as flawless as a real girl's face, with no trace of scars.

“Thank you, Ido,” Gally said. 

Ido scratched his head, embarrassed by her gratitude. "Ah, no, it's nothing... we're not done yet. I still need to finish putting together a proper body for you."

Gally smiled softly at his words and glanced downward. While her head and neck had been fully restored, her torso and limbs were still incomplete. Although Ido had managed to gather internal parts like artificial organs, a synthetic spine, and a generator, he had yet to obtain a female body frame or limbs to complete her exterior.

Even though Gally's internal parts had been restored, she was still fixed in place on the operating bed. 

"Can you hold on a little longer, Gally?" Ido said, gently touching her cheek. "I'll find arms and legs that fit you soon, I promise." 

His voice was soft, but behind his narrowed eyes, a complex emotion flickered and quickly vanished. Gally didn’t seem to notice this fleeting moment since Ido had turned his face away slightly. It was a brief, subtle pause.

Night fell over The Scrapyard. A silver moon, like frozen cold air solidified in the sky, peeked between the clouds. A man dressed in black walked alone through a dimly lit alley without street lamps. The hard clatter of the case he carried, a metallic trunk, echoed faintly in the darkness. The man in black chose the narrow, unlit streets to walk through, and then suddenly stopped. He had reached a relatively open crossroads.

The moonlight, which had been hidden by clouds until now, began to faintly illuminate the alley, revealing the face of the man dressed in black who had stopped. It was Ido Daisuke. Ido knelt down and quietly opened the trunk, pulling out a disassembled war hammer. The head of the hammer was sharply pointed, and when fully assembled, its handle was about one and a half meters long. This hammer was not a tool for driving stakes; it was a weapon, known as a "war hammer," designed to destroy enemies.

Ido silently gripped the weapon with both hands and pressed himself against the wall, holding his breath. One minute passed... then another... Ido blended into the shadows of the alley, waiting. After a while, footsteps could be heard approaching from the depths of the alley. 

"Heh, they're here," Ido muttered, his lips curling into a defiant grin. The only thing bright on him, his white gloves, tightened around the hammer's grip with a faint squeak. The footsteps grew closer and closer as the figures finally approached the crossroads where Ido lay in wait.

Long shadows stretched across the alley, dancing at Ido’s feet as he hid against the wall. The silhouettes appeared to be two women walking together. Ido casually reached into his left pocket. Pulling out a single round chip, he flicked it with a *ping* sound, sending it rolling down the alley. The chip bounced along like a wheel before tipping over in front of the women as they walked, illuminated by the moonlight.

The moment the two women saw the dark outline of the chip gleaming in the alley, their eyes widened. 

“Agh!”  
“Kyaa!”  

One of the women let out a simultaneous cry and dashed towards the chip like a monkey, her arm reaching for it. At that exact moment, Ido, having coiled his entire body with focused energy, sprang out into the moonlight, releasing all his pent-up power and ferocity.

"Oooooahhh!"

Ido leaped sideways, putting all his strength into his right foot as it hit the ground. Using it as a pivot, he swung his upper body with full force. There was a mix of sounds — a hard *thud* and a sickening *squish* — as the sharp tip of the hammer struck one of the crouching women. The instant the pointed end sank into her skull, pink sparks scattered from the back of her head. She collapsed onto her back with a heavy thud, her head surrounded by a pale pinkish-gray smear of brain matter.

The surviving woman let out a breath of rage, shaken by the gruesome sight of Ido’s lethal strike. Gritting her teeth, she glared at him furiously. Ido quickly raised his hammer and, without hesitation, swung it down from above with crushing force. The hammer hit the ground with a fierce crack, scattering sparks across the road. Ido felt a sharp pain and tingling in his hands from the impact that traveled down the handle.

There lay the woman’s left arm, shattered at the root and lying on the ground. She had narrowly escaped death by sacrificing her arm. While blood gushed from her wound, she leapt back, turned her back to Ido, and ran off into the darkness of the alley like a fleeing rabbit. As her distant screams gradually faded, Ido let out a quiet breath. He glanced around at the street, where several bloodstains bloomed like flowers, with the woman’s body and her severed left arm scattered on the ground.

"One of them got away, huh," Ido muttered coldly, adjusting the brim of his black leather hat.
