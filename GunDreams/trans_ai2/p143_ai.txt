Gally spoke out loud to the three, her voice cutting through the air. "Closing time, you bastards."

The man worth 76,000 chips, who was casually drinking whiskey, muttered a response without even turning to face her. "So what? That just means there's no one left to get in our way."

Gally replied with as steady a voice as she could muster, but the slight tremble at the end of her words made her curse silently to herself. Until now, the three bounty heads had barely reacted to the lone girl in front of them. But Gally’s provocation had changed that. In an instant, they all turned their eyes toward her, their hostile glares and palpable malice suddenly electrifying the air in the dimly lit bar.

Surrounded by their deadly intent, Gally felt a tremor run through her once again.

"Hah! Heh heh, look at this little kitten here, talking tough," sneered the man worth 60,000 chips, leaning against the wall and holding a broad curved blade. His drug-fueled body swayed as he laughed mockingly. "She’s shaking... She’s scared stiff, huh?"
