"Fushuuu... Breda, oh, how could this be? You’re trying to deny your own miraculous birth. You seem like a completely different person from your usual gentle and wise self. I swear, I saw it with my own eyes that snowy night. When dead Perché was bathed in light, you descended from the heavens, smiling down on me," Norinco said.

Gally, frustrated, responded in a firm tone, "But your eyes couldn't see by then, right? That was just a hallucination. Breda died in Perché's womb."

Gally was determined to make Norinco understand that the idea of Breda's birth was merely an illusion. She hoped that if the old man could grasp the truth, he might free himself from his fractured reality and self-punishing mindset, and perhaps even find a reason to live for himself.

"Even if I couldn’t see, I know what I saw! And if it’s not true, then the proof that you’re alive is also a fantasy... and my only reason for living too... Oh, Breda, you’re my only light, so why are you so stubborn about denying yourself?" Norinco lamented.

At that, Gally grew furious, grabbed the doll, jumped off the rickshaw, and shouted back at him.
