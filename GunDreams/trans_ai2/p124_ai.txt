Calico shouted mockingly at Norinco as she attacked fiercely. The old man, wheezing and making a hissing friction sound from his mouth, had barely launched half the attacks that Calico had so far. Every now and then, Calico's relentless kicks would land because Norinco couldn't entirely deflect the overwhelming onslaught. From an outside perspective, it appeared that Calico was completely dominating Norinco, who was only defending.

"Come on! Fight back a little, will ya?" she taunted.

However, despite her apparent upper hand, Calico hadn't inflicted any significant damage on Norinco. The old man expertly blocked her attacks, either deflecting them with his hands or adjusting his position just enough to avoid taking serious hits. Sparks would fly every time her kicks grazed his steel arms or torso, but it was all showâ€”there was no real damage being done. 

Internally, Calico struggled to remain calm as she fought desperately, her frustration building at the sight of Norinco standing unfazed after every strike. She pushed herself harder, trying to keep her composure but feeling increasingly irritated at her inability to land a decisive blow.

"Hiss... You're strong, girl. But you've got no luck at all. Whether you realize it or not, you're holding back just a bit, afraid of slipping on the wet ground. I can see it in your kicks," Norinco hissed, mocking her further. "Your precious kicks are crying, girl."
