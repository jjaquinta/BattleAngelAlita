CHAPTER 9

A cloudless night. Deep within the vast scrapyard on the outskirts of The Scrapyard, there lay a desolate ruin. Once functioning as a waste processing plant, it now served only as the resting place of a homeless old man. Orange flames flickered through a hole in the crumbling wall of the dilapidated structure. The old man, Norinco, who had been seen earlier in the day, sat by the fire, hunched over, clutching his head in despair. 

"Breda, in my foolishness...," he groaned, writhing in agony. His hunched silhouette wavered against the wall, illuminated by the flickering flames. "Please, forgive me," he pleaded. Though his eyes had long since gone blind, the last sight they captured remained vividly etched in his mind—an image so clear that, to this day, not a single day had passed without the torment of guilt and regret it evoked.

The old man's eyes still held a glimmer of light, and his black hair resembled a mane.

"Kyahhh!" "Hiiiii, it's... a Hunter!"

The underground room was the hideout of the Spine Robbery Gang. Norinco, after three months of searching the town like a bloodhound, had finally discovered this hideout. Kicking down the door, Norinco, with his wild black hair, leaped upon the bounty heads like an agile predator. Even those armed, or with cyborg bodies, were caught off guard and fell helplessly before the "Mantis Kung Fu." Sliding forward in a low stance, his sharp hand strikes sent the bounty heads sinking into a sea of blood and flesh.

It hadn't even been five minutes since Norinco had invaded the hideout. The dozen or so bounty heads were all cut down, lying cold on the floor, filling the air with the strong stench of blood. Norinco, drenched in the bloodied sea, flashed a fierce smile as he walked away from the corpses, one after another.

"Heh heh, with this many bounties, I should be able to pay off some of my debt and even buy some children's clothes," Norinco thought, eagerly awaiting the birth of his long-desired child. The tender image of parenthood, something he had dreamed of as a young orphan, had always seemed like a fantasy in this harsh reality. Not knowing his own parents had left him with a deep yearning for that connection. His desire to have his own child was especially strong. When he was around ten years old, an accident had left him with a fully cybernetic body, causing him to lose his reproductive organs. Determined to have a child, Norinco spent 50 million chips on a special fertilization procedure for his wife.

The procedure was a cutting-edge method that extracted DNA from brain cells and fused it with the DNA from an egg. The result was not a clone but a pure descendant that carried the genetic legacy of both parents. As Norinco prepared to leave the hellish underground chamber, with the bodies of numerous bounty heads hanging from his waist and hands, a heavy thud echoed behind him. When he turned around, he saw a boy, about ten years old, who had been hiding behind a pillar. The boy had dropped the knife he was holding."

Norinco, still holding severed heads in both hands, slowly walked toward the trembling boy and spoke in a calm tone. "What's wrong? If you don't hurry, I'll hunt you down too."

"D-Damn it... You killed my dad!" The boy, with tears of fear and anger streaming down his face, picked up the too-heavy knife and wobbled as he tried to swing it. But Norinco easily kicked it away and spoke softly, "I'm in a good mood today. I'm not so bored that I'd hunt down a child who isn't even a bounty."

Then, in a harsher, commanding voice, he continued, "Kid, if you don't want to die, get lost!"

The boy shuddered as if shocked by electricity, then ran off as fast as he could. 

*Did my parents disappear in front of me like that, too?* Norinco wondered. *Will that boy, like me, carry an insatiable hunger for his lost family for the rest of his life?*

Sighing, Norinco shook his head at the thought of feeling pity for the boy. Normally, he would have killed the child without hesitation. But now, he couldn't help feeling sentimental when it came to children.

Norinco stepped out of the basement and felt something cold gently fall on his forehead. "Oh, snow... when did it start?" The pure white crystals born from the darkness softly made a faint *sff* sound as they began to accumulate on the dimly lit street. "I'm coming home, darling..." Leaving footprints in the snow, Norinco hurried down the street and disappeared into the night.

His child—had they been born yet?

In a rundown apartment tucked away in a back alley, far from the main streets, was Norinco's home. "Has the baby been born, Belchere? Is our child here yet?" Bursting into the room with an armful of bounty heads, Norinco eagerly asked the woman lying on the bed.

"No, not yet, dear. But it will be soon. This little one keeps kicking, eager to meet their father."

Norinco's wife, Belchere, gently stroked her growing belly and let out a soft sigh. He placed the bounty heads he had been holding on the table and cautiously walked over to the bed, softly touching his wife's swollen abdomen.

"Oh, oh... it's moving. The child inside you is the only thing that gives my life meaning. In this city, where dreams and hope are nonexistent, all I've ever wished for is to raise our child. That wish will soon come true. Thank you."

Belchere gently placed her hand over Norinco's steel one on her belly, shaking her head slightly as she spoke.

"I'm the one who should be thanking you, Norinco. You took in someone like me—just another woman leading a miserable life—and have treated me with such care, making me feel special."

Hearing her words, Norinco's expression clouded, and he averted his eyes.

"No... I'm not a man worthy of your gratitude. To be honest, any woman who could bear my child would have sufficed for me. And for that, I'm truly sorry."

Belchere didn’t let her expression darken in the slightest at Norinco's hesitant words. Instead, she gave him a smile as radiant as a flower. Then, she sat up halfway in bed and gently wrapped her arms around his back, pulling him close.

"That’s perfectly fine with me. I never imagined I could find any meaning in life during those days of hardship. But you gave me the precious duty of bringing a child into this world. That alone makes me incredibly happy now. ...Norinco, I’m truly glad to be alive."

Norinco, in turn, wrapped his arms around her back and embraced her. Then, raising his face, he offered her a rare smile and said, "Belchere, I will always take pride in the fact that I am having a child with you."

After that, Norinco slowly stepped away from the bed and grabbed the bounty heads neatly lined up on the table.

"For the sake of our child, who will likely be born tomorrow, I need to turn these bounty heads into chips. I have to hire the doctor and midwives first thing in the morning."

"By the time you return, make sure to wash your face, so you don’t scare the baby," Belchere said with a soft smile. It was only then that Norinco realized his body was still covered in dried blood, giving him a dark, mottled appearance. Shrugging lightly, he left the room.

After walking for about thirty minutes, Norinco arrived at the Factory. He handed over all the bounty heads to Deckman, the human interface inside the Factory, and exchanged them for chips.

"One hundred and ten thousand chips, huh... not bad," Norinco muttered to himself as he walked through the snow-covered alley, jingling the chips in his pocket. Even after paying off his debts, he would have forty thousand chips left.

Instead of heading straight home, Norinco decided to make a slight detour. "Might as well celebrate the birth of my child a little early," he thought as he stepped through the door of his usual bar on the main street. By adjusting the alcohol decomposition function, even a cyborg could enjoy a drink. 

For about an hour, he quietly drank alone, contemplating names for his unborn child, wondering if it would be a boy or a girl.

Norinco wandered into an alley after leaving the bar, slightly unsteady on his feet from drinking. His apartment was relatively close, about a ten-minute walk, which allowed him to loosen up a bit and have more to drink than usual. As snowflakes fell gently onto his heated face, it felt refreshing, and he walked slowly, gazing up at the night sky.

After about five minutes of walking through the back alleys in a dreamy state, Norinco suddenly caught a whiff of something burning. "What's this smell...?" he muttered suspiciously, wrinkling his brow and sniffing the air. Something was definitely burning nearby.

"Outta the way!" 

Just as Norinco was trying to figure out what might be burning, a child suddenly burst from the corner of the alley, running frantically. The child collided with Norinco and fell hard but got back up without so much as a glance in his direction before taking off at full speed again.

The child ran off toward the main street, disappearing from sight.

"What the... What the hell is going on?" Norinco mumbled, his drunken speech slurred, shaking his head in confusion. As he gathered his thoughts, he realized something familiar about the child who had just bumped into him. 

"Wait a minute... that kid... Could it be?" 

"Dammit, you killed my father!" 

The image of the boy he had spared earlier that night flashed vividly in Norinco's mind. The appearance, the presence, the voice—all matched perfectly with the boy he had encountered just an hour ago. His mind suddenly cleared from the fog of alcohol, and Norinco clenched his teeth, glaring into the dark alley that reeked of burning. 

The faint smell from before had now grown stronger, filled with a sharp, acrid stench that stung his nose. 

"No... It can't be. No way!" 

A terrible premonition welled up inside him, making him feel nauseous. Without hesitation, Norinco started running down the snowy alley, driven by an overwhelming sense of dread.

"My child... my child!" Norinco screamed as he sprinted through the alley, only to be greeted by a scene of utter devastation. His dilapidated apartment was engulfed in raging flames, spewing fire into the night sky.

"Nooooooo!" He let out a feral roar as he ran towards the burning building, ignoring the flames licking at the entrance.

"Hey, that's crazy!"  
"It's already too late!" Some of the onlookers shouted at him as they watched the inferno, but by the time they spoke, Norinco had already charged into the fire, disappearing from view.

"I’ll save you, my child!" he cried, ignoring the searing heat that was already beginning to scorch his body. With swift movements, he darted up the crumbling staircase, reaching the third floor where his room was. The hallway on that floor was engulfed in the fiercest flames.

There was no doubt in his mind—the boy he had spared had set this fire, targeting him.

It was clear that a large amount of oil had been used to meticulously set the fire. The flames raged inside like the furnace of a crematorium, consuming the building. 

With a wild, animalistic shriek, Norinco hurled himself into the inferno, plunging into the intense heat. He powered up his cyborg body to its maximum and smashed through the wall of the room. 

"My child!!!" he screamed, but it was in vain. The room where Belchea had been was already ravaged by the same flames that consumed the hallway. Still burning from the fire clinging to his clothes, Norinco stepped into the room and was met with the horrific sight of his wife's charred corpse. 

It was clear that she had tried to protect their unborn child until her final moments. She had collapsed on the floor, curled around her belly. While her back and head had been severely burned, the abdomen where their child lay was untouched, almost as if it were still alive. 

"Belchea... I'm so sorry. My child, please forgive me," Norinco wailed. "I made enemies with the wrong people, and now... this."

"If only I hadn't stopped to drink... If I had just gone home, you both wouldn't have had to suffer such a horrible death..." 

Norinco, engulfed in flames, consumed by grief, reached up to his own eyes and gouged them out. "This pain, this suffering... it's nothing compared to what you went through!" 

Blood poured from the hollow sockets where his eyes had been as he cradled Belchea's charred corpse. Then, holding her tightly, he leapt from the burning building. Falling from a height of about ten meters, he landed with a heavy thud, his feet sinking into the snow-covered alleyway. 

Norinco let out a primal scream into the snowy night sky, a cry filled with rage and sorrow. With everything lost to the flames—his unborn child and his beloved wife—he stumbled down the alley, disappearing like a shadow into the snowfall. 

More than fifty years passed since that fateful day, as time moved on relentlessly in front of Norinco.

Norinco, his white hair disheveled, was shedding tears from his blind eyes, writhing in agony. "Forgive me. Please, forgive me," he repeated in his heart, clawing at his head as if to silence the flames of the campfire that illuminated him. 

"Norinco... Norinco... Lift your head." 

At that moment, amidst his groaning, a voice echoed in his mind. 

"Norinco, don’t blame yourself too much..."

"Bredda... It’s you, Bredda, isn't it? Oh, my beloved Bredda, my miraculous child... Are you here to comfort this sinful heap of flesh?"

Crying, Norinco crawled towards the doll of the young girl propped up on the chair and clung to her knees. The doll's face, illuminated by the flickering flames, seemed to change expressions as if it were alive.

"You are so kind. Whenever I feel lonely, you always take me to visit my friends..."

"Oh, oh... I'll always take you to visit your friends so you won’t ever be lonely..."

"Are you still not done playing with your friends, Bredda?" Norinco asked, lifting his face from the doll's lap. In his blind eyes, it was as if Bredda was smiling clearly at him. 

"Alright, Bredda, I understand. Let's go find some more friends together. And we'll make sure to have plenty of fun with them," Norinco nodded repeatedly, standing up as he stripped off all his clothing. Then, he carefully undressed the doll he called Bredda, removing the mannequin head and placing it gently to the side. The old man opened the maintenance hatch of her body, and then his own. 

With practiced hands, Norinco began bypassing and connecting their internal systems, gradually sharing functions between himself and the Bredda doll. Finally, when he could no longer move his own body, he used the doll's arms to transfer his own head onto Bredda's body. 

Once the process was complete, Norinco's expression and demeanor had completely transformed into something that resembled an entirely different creature. 

"Hush... Bredda, I hope that nosy woman doesn’t show up like last time. Well, she's probably at the bottom of the sewer river by now, staring up at the surface."

Covered in white hair entangled around his body, Norinco, now inside Bredda’s body, wheezed and strapped a long, deadly knife to his waist before leaving the ruins and heading into the night town. He was out once again to hunt fresh prey to offer Bredda tonight.
