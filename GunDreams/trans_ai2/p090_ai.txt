“Haha, Gally, really, you shouldn’t be calling an active, single working girl like me ‘Auntie,’” Shig said with a laugh as she turned and quickly disappeared down the alley. Gally and Kyariko watched her go, then left the entertainment district and headed toward the Factory. That was the last time anyone ever saw Shig.

The Factory was the ground management system controlled by the aerial city of Zalem, which maintained and governed The Scrapyard. Initially, the Factory was simply a system necessary for running the ground-level factories that produced goods for Zalem. However, as more people gathered in the city, drawn by factory jobs and the scrap recycling business, the city expanded, and with it, the issues and crimes increased. In response, the Factory's role grew and diversified into a governing body that handled these troubles. Today, it serves as the core of judicial, legislative, and administrative functions for the city.

In the dim night, the Factory loomed faintly under scattered lights. Massive steel pipes coiled and intertwined, converging as the structure towered high. Looking up, one could see a thick, ivory-colored pipe extending from the top of the structure, stretching toward the sky.
