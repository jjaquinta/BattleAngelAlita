I received these encouraging words. Still, when I was asked to write this novel after not having published a single piece of work for so long, it was easy to imagine myself being clumsy and struggling with my own inadequacies. I initially wondered if I should decline the offer out of fear of facing that reality. However, when I considered why the teacher would give me, a "frog in a well," the opportunity to see the vastness of the sky, I realized I couldn't refuse. The teacher not only acknowledged the potential in me, a "frog who doesn’t take risks," but was also concerned that I wasn’t confronting my own abilities. Thinking about this, I knew that, as a "frog," I needed to rise to the occasion and take on this challenge to repay my teacher and for my own sake.

Yukito-san, thank you for always sparring with me using the bamboo sword. 

That’s the backstory behind this novel, and now all I can do is hope that as many people as possible will feel, "That was good." I am honored if you have read it.
