"Ahh, stop it!"

The man was already beyond hope.

"Is that all you have left to say? Come on, it's your last chance, say something witty and die with a bit of dignity, okay?"

Sensing the end, the man thrashed about, but a full-body cyborg, even in a female form, possesses considerable power. The man screamed again as the heat from the blade extending from the woman's leg nearly burned him.

"Ahh... Dad, Mom...!!"

As if to silence the man's final words, the woman carelessly pressed the blade of her leg against the man's neck. With a heavy sound, the stench of burning flesh filled the air as his head separated from his body. In an instant, the man's body twitched two or three times before going completely still.

The woman let out a small sigh, leaning against the wall as she rummaged through her coat pocket. She pulled her hand from the pocket, holding something.
