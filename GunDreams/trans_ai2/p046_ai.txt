Ido leaped sideways, putting all his strength into his right foot as it hit the ground. Using it as a pivot, he swung his upper body with full force. There was a mix of sounds — a hard *thud* and a sickening *squish* — as the sharp tip of the hammer struck one of the crouching women. The instant the pointed end sank into her skull, pink sparks scattered from the back of her head. She collapsed onto her back with a heavy thud, her head surrounded by a pale pinkish-gray smear of brain matter.

The surviving woman let out a breath of rage, shaken by the gruesome sight of Ido’s lethal strike. Gritting her teeth, she glared at him furiously. Ido quickly raised his hammer and, without hesitation, swung it down from above with crushing force. The hammer hit the ground with a fierce crack, scattering sparks across the road. Ido felt a sharp pain and tingling in his hands from the impact that traveled down the handle.
