"Don't think you can hunt me so easily."

The man licked the blood from his right arm, lowered his stance, and readied his machete. His posture, honed from surviving countless battlefields, showed no significant openings.

"A serial killer who targets only women, now that would bring in a slightly better reward... but for today, I'll settle for you."

"Cali!"

With a sharp breath, the man kicked off the ground. His leap, seemingly beyond the capabilities of a human, was like that of a mountain monkey. His mechanical left arm unleashed tremendous power, accelerating the machete’s blade, which sliced through the air with a whistle-like sound. This was the man’s one-strike-kill technique, the same move he had used to dispatch many victims and pursuers alike. He brought the machete down in a straight slash aimed at the shadow’s skull.

Just as the deadly blade was about to make contact with the top of the shadow’s head, the glint of the machete’s edge reflected in the shadow's eyes, sending a flash of light through them.
