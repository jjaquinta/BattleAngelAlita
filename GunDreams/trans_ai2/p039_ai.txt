Gonzu let out a belch as he approached the girl fixed to the operating table, his face flushed red. To Gonzu and most ordinary people, she would indeed appear to be nothing more than junk. Half-destroyed, non-functional cyborgs were a common sight in The Scrapyard, often scattered along the streets. Though they wouldnâ€™t last long before being picked up by dealers, dismantled, and recycled into something useful.

"Calling her junk is harsh. This girl is a proper human being," Ido said, showing the monitor to Gonzu. Gonzu rubbed his thick chin with a finger, blinking his droopy eyelids as he peered at the screen.

"Wait a minute... Are you telling me this old, busted-up heap is still functional?" Gonzu looked at Ido with genuine surprise.

Ido grinned with satisfaction and nodded. "After checking, I found that her brain had been inactive in the scrap heap for about 200 years. But someone took measures to preserve her brain tissue. And I managed to bring her brain back to life."

"Man... You're into some weird stuff, aren't you?" Gonzu muttered.
