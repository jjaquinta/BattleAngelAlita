Calico clicked her tongue in irritation and, shaking her wild, disheveled white hair, she landed a fierce front kick into Norinco's torso. The old man quickly crossed his arms to block the blow, bending his body like a hinge as he deliberately leapt backward. Though he was sent flying several meters, skidding across the wet ground, he managed to stop himself without taking any significant damage.

"Too bad... There's no next time to try again. Hissss... Don't panic now. Even with those dull eyes of yours struggling to keep up, you're putting in the effort, huh?" Norinco wheezed mockingly.

"Huh? What are you talking about? You can't see...?" Calico, startled, hesitated in her attacks. It was hard to believe that the old man, who had been evading her relentless strikes so easily, was actually blind.

"Hissss... Go on, take a look. Do you see any eyes on me?" The old man rasped, pushing aside the tangled white hair that covered his face with both hands.

Calico's breath caught in her throat as she stared in shock at the strange sight beneath his hair. In place of eyes, the old man had nothing but small, white dish-like objects where his eyeballs should have been.
