Ido, with his palms clenched in excitement, called out to her.
"Yes, I'm going."
Gally put strength into her machine arms, lowering herself from the wheelchair's armrest to raise her waist.
"You can do it, go for it, Gally."
Ido, with his palms clenched in excitement, called out to her. Watching Gally nervously step forward, he couldn't help but step forward himself. Gally, as if stepping into water, cautiously placed one foot on the ground, followed by the other.
"I... Ido..."
Gally had a puzzled expression on her face. Ido, seeing her like that, broke into a smile, unable to hold back. He walked toward her with slightly awkward steps and embraced her.
