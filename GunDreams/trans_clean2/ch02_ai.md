# CHAPTER 2

At the edge of **The Scrapyard**, mounds of discarded remnants from a lost age lay in a vast, ring-like formation. The landscape was desolate, a sprawling graveyard of rusting metal and forgotten technologies. These towering mountains of waste, the decaying relics of past centuries, had been piling up for hundreds of years, forming ridges that crisscrossed the surface like the scars of an ancient wound. 

It seemed like a dead world, but for those who knew where to look, it was a treasure trove—an unending reservoir of forgotten resources. 

The season had turned after October, and the red light of a dying sun bathed the scrapyard in molten hues. Half-buried beneath the heaps of metal and detritus, the body of a girl was slowly emerging, exposed by the ceaseless work of the heavy machinery sifting through the mountains. She had been lost in the depths for centuries, but now, by the hand of chance, she was freed.

In the deepest part of this wasteland, she had lain dormant—a machine, devoid of life or function. Time had long since passed for the consciousness that once animated this body. The girl’s form was made of steel and ceramic, a construct built to withstand time, but even that resilience had its limits. Hundreds of years had left her a relic, her systems long shut down, her essence forgotten.

---

A figure scrambled down a steep slope of metal debris, his breath catching with excitement.

“Aah... Ahhh... Wow!” Ido Daisuke, his movements frantic, slipped and tumbled down through the scrap in his haste. His eyes gleamed with the joy of discovery. Amid the decay and ruin, he had found something remarkable: an angel of machines, sleeping beneath the rubble. His heart raced as he hurried closer, his mind alive with the possibilities of what lay before him.

There, half-buried and rusted over, lay the girl.

To the trained eye, like Ido’s, her external appearance seemed to be that of a young woman, perhaps fifteen or sixteen years old. Her hair had long since disintegrated, but her face—smooth, egg-shaped, and hauntingly serene—remained intact, untouched by time. Her features, though dulled by centuries of decay, suggested a delicate beauty. Her eyes were closed, their lids unmarked, her nose small but with a straight, noble bridge. Her lips, though thin, were full, still holding an impression of life long extinguished.

Ido’s hands trembled as he reached out, gently brushing her cheek. The synthetic skin, worn from time and exposure, cracked beneath his touch like brittle rubber. 

---

The girl’s body, though damaged, was a marvel of ancient technology. Her artificial limbs, or what remained of them, bore the unmistakable craftsmanship of a bygone era—an age when cyborg technology had far surpassed the crude methods of the present day. Yet, even with his skilled eyes, Ido saw the truth: she was incomplete, beyond saving.

Her arms were missing, as were her legs. Her torso was mangled, the artificial organs inside crushed and useless. Her spine had been severed, leaving her a mere shell of what she once was. Even the neural systems that should have powered her thoughts were gone. She was nothing more than broken remnants—scrap, like everything else in this wasteland.

A pang of regret touched Ido’s heart. *If only I had found her a hundred years earlier...*

With a sigh, he stood and turned his back on the girl, ready to leave her behind, a piece of history too far gone to reclaim. Yet, as he began his descent back down the slope, something made him pause. He glanced back at the girl’s still form, now bathed in the deep orange glow of the setting sun.

*Why can’t I let this go?* 

There was something about her, something that tugged at him, an inexplicable sense that she wasn’t truly dead. His rational mind argued against it—her systems were long since destroyed, her body little more than rusted parts. And yet...

Ido found himself climbing back up the slope. His thoughts warred with each other, but curiosity had won out. He knelt beside her once more. *The heart, lungs, generator—they’re all gone. She’s beyond repair...*

But there was one part he hadn’t yet checked: her brain.

---

With cautious hands, Ido cradled the girl’s head, gently tapping the side of her skull. Inside, something felt solid, preserved. His pulse quickened. Could it be that, after all these centuries, her brain had been kept intact?

It was a ridiculous notion. The chances of such a thing were infinitesimally small. A human brain could not simply lie dormant for hundreds of years without decaying into dust. Yet, as he held the weight of her head in his hands, Ido felt an undeniable certainty growing inside him.

He began to tremble. “No... this can’t be...”

His fingers brushed the surface of her skull again, and there was no mistaking it—the center of gravity inside had not shifted. Her brain was still there, sealed and preserved within the casing of her head. The revelation hit him like a bolt of lightning.

---

Ido’s mind raced as he carried the girl’s body back to his clinic in **The Scrapyard**. His hands gripped the controls of his vehicle with white-knuckled determination. The stars had already begun to appear, twinkling in the sky as he sped toward his home.

Inside the clinic, the sterile light of his operating room flickered to life as he laid the girl on the table. The machines around him hummed, preparing for the delicate task ahead. Ido’s hands moved with precision, his mind focused on the impossible challenge of reviving this ancient cyborg.

Data scrolled across the monitors as Ido ran scans, his eyes darting from one display to another. The readings were astonishing. The girl’s brain had been plastinated, preserved in a frozen state for centuries. It was a process he had only read about, a technique thought to have been lost in the distant past.

"Whoever did this..." Ido whispered, his voice tinged with awe, "they preserved her with a method far beyond anything we use today."

---

For three days, Ido worked without rest. He pushed the limits of his knowledge, tapping into the arcane medical data he had accumulated over years of study. Finally, on the third night, the girl stirred.

Her eyelids fluttered, and Ido held his breath. Slowly, her eyes opened, revealing large, dark pupils that seemed to drink in the light.

“Hey,” Ido said softly, leaning closer, his heart pounding. “I’m Ido. What’s your name?”

The girl blinked, her gaze unfocused, as if she were waking from a long, dreamless sleep. “Na...mae?” she murmured, her voice soft and unsure.

Ido smiled gently, shaking his head. “That’s alright. You’ve been asleep for a long time. Your memories will return, eventually. But for now, let me give you a name.”

He hesitated for a moment, then nodded to himself. “From today, your name is Alita.”

The girl—Alita—looked at him, her expression softening. She had lost everything, her past, her body, even her sense of self. But in that moment, the name felt right, a small anchor in the storm of her confusion.

---

Five days later, Alita sat propped up on the operating table, her eyes wide as Ido held a mirror in front of her. Her reflection stared back at her—smooth, synthetic skin, unblemished and flawless. Her hair, restored to a sleek black, framed her delicate features.

“Is this... me?” she asked in wonder, her voice barely a whisper.

Ido grinned. “It’s you, alright. But we’re not finished yet. I still need to find the right parts for the rest of your body.”

She smiled, grateful, but as she glanced down, she saw the truth of his words. Her torso was still incomplete, her arms and legs missing. Though her internal systems had been restored, she was far from whole.

Ido placed a hand on her shoulder. “Don’t worry. I’ll get you fully operational soon.”

---

Night fell over **The Scrapyard**, casting long shadows over the twisted, broken landscape. Ido moved silently through the dim alleys, a metallic case clutched tightly in his hands. The moon, cold and distant, peeked through the clouds, illuminating the path before him.

Reaching a crossroads, Ido knelt, opening the case to reveal the disassembled pieces of a war hammer. His hands worked quickly, fitting the pieces together until the weapon stood ready—a brutal instrument of destruction.

He pressed himself against the wall, waiting.

Footsteps echoed through the alley. Two figures approached, their shapes elongated in the moonlight. Ido’s muscles tensed. He flicked a small chip into the alley with a metallic *ping*, drawing the attention of one of the figures.

As the woman crouched to retrieve it, Ido struck.

---

The hammer descended with brutal force, the sharp end sinking into her skull. Sparks flew as her body collapsed, lifeless, to the ground. The second woman let out a cry of fury, but before she could react, Ido swung again.

His hammer missed

 her head by a fraction of a second, shattering her left arm at the root. She screamed, blood spraying as she fled into the darkness.

Ido stood alone in the alley, the quiet night settling over him once more. He glanced down at the broken body at his feet and sighed.

“One got away.”

His white gloves, stained with blood, tightened around the grip of his war hammer. The moonlight flickered through the clouds as he adjusted his hat and disappeared into the shadows.
