Gally trembled at Kyariko’s words and lowered her head in silence. After a moment, she looked up and spoke to Kyariko with determination.

“Ido is against me becoming a Hunter, but… this is something I’ve decided for myself. It’s true that if it weren’t for Ido, I wouldn’t be alive right now, but as long as I am alive, I need proof—for myself. I want to do something that helps me find out why I’m alive. I want to become a Hunter-Warrior!”

After she finished speaking, Gally pressed her lips together tightly and lowered her head again, clenching her hands so hard that her shoulders shook slightly. 

Kyariko let out a soft sigh and placed her hand on Gally’s shoulder. 

“Lift your head, Gally. You look like a child being scolded, hanging your head like that. Honestly, if you have such a pure desire to live your life, that’s admirable. Fine, I’ll teach you how to become a Hunter. Okay?”

“Really, Kyariko…?” Gally asked, her voice filled with hope.
