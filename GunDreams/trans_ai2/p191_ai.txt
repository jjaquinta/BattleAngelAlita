"Listen carefully, Norinco. Breda was never born. This is just a doll," Gally said firmly. "You know that deep down, don't you?"

"A doll? Breda, a doll? Fushuuu, what are you saying, Breda?" Norinco asked, confused. Gally handed him the lifeless Breda doll and shook him gently.

"Look, it doesn’t move at all. It doesn’t even have a pulse. This is just a shell, a part of a cyborg—it’s only a doll. And the one talking to you right now is me, Gally. My name is Gally."

Norinco clutched the lifeless form of Breda in his arms, trembling as he tried to reject the painful truth. He began to sweat as he heard the voice of a girl—clearly not Breda—speaking to him from another direction.

"What’s wrong, Breda? Why aren’t you speaking to me today like you usually do? Why are you so limp?" he asked, desperate.

"Breda was born... she was born..." Norinco muttered.

"You’ve been lying to yourself all this time because you couldn’t forgive yourself, but that’s not right," Gally said, her voice filled with frustration.

Norinco let out a long, anguished cry, unable to accept the truth.
