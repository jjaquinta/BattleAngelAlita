POSTSCRIPT

I am deeply grateful to Mr. Kishiro (though calling him "Mr." feels a bit awkward) and Deputy Editor-in-Chief Hasaka. This novel is a story themed around "reality and unreality" and how the characters grapple with each. The violent Colt, who defines truth as the satisfaction of desires. Norinco, who bears the burden of an unfulfilling past and escapes reality by embracing fiction as truth, alongside a doll in his dual personality. Ido, a good doctor with a hunter's taste for murder, seeking an ideal detached from reality. Each of these characters is confronted with their own reality and unique truths, and nothing is certain. How does Gally face these challenges and reflect on them? I wanted to depict her earnest struggle in this work.

Additionally, the existence of Calico, a disciple of Clive Lee, the rental body shop, and the martial arts scenes featured in the story were added to bring in the fun of "Kawamura Original." I wonder if I succeeded. When I was an assistant, I was told by my teacher, "Go your own way," and was let go. The following year, in his New Year's card, the teacher wrote to me, "Strike out boldly."
