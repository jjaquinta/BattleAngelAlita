The man had probably joined a mystical cult in The Scrapyard for some reason, where living a life steeped in cactus smoke was not uncommon. From there, he drowned in the tastes of his rural hometown, using hallucinations daily until it became his reality. Eventually, bad trips led to repeated murders, and he became a wanted criminal.

He had come from the countryside, faced failure in The Scrapyard, turned to drugs, and descended into madness. This, too, was a common story for people in The Scrapyard.

She flicked away her worn-out cigarette and casually walked away, holding the man’s severed head in one hand. The night breeze slipped through, giving the hem of her coat the slightest flutter as it passed.
