The red-haired woman shook the dazed Gally and lightly slapped her cheeks. "Come on, snap out of it. That was nothing, you know. It's just a hunter's job," she said. Gradually, the focus returned to Gally's once-vacant eyes. 

"Ido isn't a serial killer; he's a hunter who hunts down serial killers," the red-haired woman explained. Gally fully came to her senses and grabbed the woman's collar. "A hunter? What do you mean? He just killed that woman like that!" 

The red-haired woman began to explain the existence of Hunter-Warriors in The Scrapyard. In The Scrapyard, aside from crimes that concern the Factory or Zalem, everything is handled by the Factory placing bounties on the heads of criminals to maintain order. The bounty hunters who pursue these marked criminals and eliminate them are called Hunter-Warriors in The Scrapyard.

"So, the woman Ido just killed was..."

"Yeah, she was on the list. One of the insane mutant sisters, Asnas."
