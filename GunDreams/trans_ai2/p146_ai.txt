Gallyâ€™s reverse roundhouse kick echoed through the room with the sound of bones shattering, sending the head of the 60,000-chip man flying through the air. "Two more to go!" Gally shouted as she spun across the floor, ready for her next target. The man worth 76,000 chips, momentarily stunned by her unexpected combat prowess, stood up from the counter, baring his teeth before spitting on the floor in fury.

"You brat! Damn you!" he snarled, flinging open the front of his black coat. Inside, it was lined with throwing knives, like silver scales. With practiced ease, he grabbed four in each hand, eight in total. "Take this!" he roared, hurling the knives with speed and precision, aiming directly at Gally as she closed the distance. 

Sensing the danger, Gally swiftly dodged to the side, causing the knives to miss their mark and pierce the floor instead, riddling it with holes like a honeycomb. Gally rolled to the side and used a fallen round table as cover, stopping her movement to conceal herself behind it.
