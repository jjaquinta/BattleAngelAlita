"Damn it!" Calico cursed as she struggled against Norinco's mysterious fighting style. Though she was able to fend off severe damage with desperate defense, she was nearing her limit against the elderly man's refined techniques. 

"Hisss... Ah, seems like you're used to attacking from a distance, aren't you? But you've never dealt with someone up close, have you? In close combat, your skills are quite sloppy," Norinco taunted, slithering with confidence.

Damn... not yet. Calico wasn’t just being tossed around aimlessly—she had secretly triggered the red-hot blade function in her leg when they arrived at this spot. Drawing power from the last battery cartridge, the thirty-centimeter electric heat blade hidden in her right leg was now heating up inside the holster, glowing red-hot. Though she hadn’t preheated it and was relying on residual heat, which lowered its reliability, it was still her trump card with enough destructive power to potentially turn the tide.

"Hisss... Oh, you're planning something, aren't you? Hahaha, go ahead, try to kill me if you can," Norinco sneered, clearly sensing the determined aura emanating from Calico despite her pain.
