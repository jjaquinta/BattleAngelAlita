"You… you're no ordinary person, are you?" The figure of the old man, whose grotesque, steel hands had just euthanized Shig, stepped out from the shadows, emitting strange, wheezing breaths. In the pouring rain, Calico watched as this small, elderly, full-body cyborg emerged into her line of sight. Despite his size, his appearance was a horrifying reflection of the madness that drove a serial killer.

His face was hidden beneath wild, tangled white hair, with only his wrinkled, twisted mouth visible in a sneer. Below his unsettling head, his body had been replaced with a genderless, female-style cyborg frame. His left arm, replaced from shoulder to wrist with a horrifying, multi-jointed machine resembling the segmented exoskeleton of a centipede, was capable of extending and contracting.

The only clothing this grotesque old man wore was a scrap of fabric, with large machete-like knives dangling from his waist on either side. 

"Shut up… I don't mix personal feelings with my hunts, you hear?" Calico narrowed her eyes, licking her full red lips with a long tongue. At her words, the old man clicked his tongue in disapproval, muttering softly, "What a waste…" He grinned darkly beneath his mess of white hair and slowly spoke again.
