Gally pouted, her lips still pursed in dissatisfaction. She didn't fully understand that Ido's worries were unrelated to her high abilities or trustworthiness. Being naturally straightforward, Gally had a tendency to understand things very simply. While she could grasp the idea that "being strong means there's nothing to worry about," she struggled to comprehend the more nuanced concern that "even if you're strong, that doesn’t stop someone from worrying."

Crouching under the streetlight, Gally watched the flow of people passing by. With only three months' worth of memories, everything still felt new and exciting to her, including simply observing people move through the city. There had even been times when she got so absorbed in watching the never-ending flow of people late into the night that she didn't realize the sky had begun to lighten with dawn.

"Hmm? Who’s that?" she murmured, her attention caught by a group passing nearby. Gally pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from her pocket and glanced between the paper and the people walking by, comparing them. Her eyes lit up, and she stood, eagerly following them into the crowd. The crumpled paper in her hand was a printed bounty list.
