What was it again...?
The woman blew a puff of cigarette smoke onto the man's neck.
"You went and did something dumb like tripping out on mescaline, some old-school drug, and went on a flashy killing spree of laborers, which is why I'm hunting you down now, you know?"
Mescaline is an alkaloid extracted from cacti and is a hallucinogenic plant-based drug. Unlike chemically produced stimulants like LSD, cocaine and mescaline can be easily refined in large quantities from cultivated crops if quality isn't a concern. Sure, because of this ease of production, mescaline was a popular drug in the desert areas outside The Scrapyard, where many mescaline-containing cactus species grow. However, inside The Scrapyard, where much more potent and addictive synthetic drugs were in vogue, it was little more than a cheap mist that outdated mystic cults would make their followers sniff.
Due to its simple effects, low persistence, and the need to consume it in large quantities, only backwater villagers or farm-dwelling bumpkins from the outskirts of The Scrapyard still regularly used mescaline.
