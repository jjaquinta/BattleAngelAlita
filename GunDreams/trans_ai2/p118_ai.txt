A bolt of lightning illuminated the scene for a brief moment, casting it in an eerie blue light, and even the bold Kyarriko couldn't help but let out a low groan. 

The figure standing there was a woman. She glistened in the torrential rain, her skin slick with the water. But it wasn't her nudity that made her so grotesque. Both of her arms had been brutally severed at the shoulders, leaving streams of blood running down her body and painting the ground in red. A single slash ran from her chest down to her navel, her intestines, stained pink with blood, spilling out like a grotesque sash clinging to her legs. Despite the massive blood loss and unimaginable pain, she was somehow still alive, wheezing with shallow breaths as she staggered forward.

"Sh—Shig..." Kyarriko immediately recognized who the woman was. The disfigured woman, beaten and bloodied in the storm, was undoubtedly Shig—the old prostitute she had known since their early days together.
