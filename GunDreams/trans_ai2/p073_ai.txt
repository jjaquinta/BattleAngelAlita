With a quiet chuckle, the red-haired woman motioned with her chin for Gally to look down from the building. Though slightly annoyed at being ordered around, Gally pouted her own thick lips, not wanting to lose to the woman, and peeked over the edge.

“Ah, that’s... Ido...”

About ten meters below, in a small intersection of alleyways, a black figure was lurking. The figure was unmistakably Ido, dressed in his usual black attire, leaning against the shadow of a building that framed the alley. Next to him was the large trunk case that Gally had seen when he had snuck out earlier.

Ido was holding an abnormally large hammer in his arms. The tip of the hammer was sharply pointed—clearly not meant for driving stakes or anything practical.

“What... what is Ido planning to do?” Gally muttered in a mix of suspicion and concern. Just then, faint footsteps echoed from the darkness of the alley. A silhouette, seemingly of a woman, began to emerge toward the alley where Ido was hiding. Ido, of course, remained still, unnoticed.
