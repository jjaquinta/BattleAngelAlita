Sweat and tears streamed down the man's face as if his skin were melting, and he pleaded with the woman. However, she slowly shook her head in response. A few strands of her thin, reddish hair touched her white forehead and swayedâ€”a sign of refusal.

"If I don't cash in a hunter's head at the Factory, I can't recharge my cartridges. Without the heat, my red-hot legs would just be pop-out knives, wouldn't they?"

While still stepping on the man, the woman turned sideways and slowly stepped her right foot beside the trembling man's neck. The eyes of the man lying face-down widened as if they might pop out, fixated on the cold, dull-colored steel leg of the woman.

"Since it's a special occasion, I'll let you see my red-hot leg up close, okay? Look, it's still hot from the residual heat."

With the sound of modules activating, the steel toes of the woman's foot split open, and from the calf area, a dangerous blade with the sharpness of a spear and the thickness of a knife slowly emerged from the ankle. The blade was slightly charred and blackened, with a thin layer of soot-like substance clinging to the edge. Its center glowed faintly red, radiating heat.
