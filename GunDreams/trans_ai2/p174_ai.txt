"If only I hadn't stopped to drink... If I had just gone home, you both wouldn't have had to suffer such a horrible death..." 

Norinco, engulfed in flames, consumed by grief, reached up to his own eyes and gouged them out. "This pain, this suffering... it's nothing compared to what you went through!" 

Blood poured from the hollow sockets where his eyes had been as he cradled Belchea's charred corpse. Then, holding her tightly, he leapt from the burning building. Falling from a height of about ten meters, he landed with a heavy thud, his feet sinking into the snow-covered alleyway. 

Norinco let out a primal scream into the snowy night sky, a cry filled with rage and sorrow. With everything lost to the flames—his unborn child and his beloved wife—he stumbled down the alley, disappearing like a shadow into the snowfall. 

More than fifty years passed since that fateful day, as time moved on relentlessly in front of Norinco.
