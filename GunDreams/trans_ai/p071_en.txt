The one who was blown away was Gally.
The one who intercepted Gally’s high-speed approaching kick was the red-haired woman. Gally, being significantly smaller, couldn’t match the power of the red-haired woman’s kick. Gally, knocked off balance, slammed into the wall with a crash.
"You said Ido, didn’t you? Could it be you’re Ido’s daughter, hmm?"
Gally, grimacing from a concussion, shook her head and stuck out her tongue. "Ido is the one who saved my life."
The red-haired woman remained silent for a while, observing Gally’s face, before letting out a sigh and standing up. As Gally’s consciousness began to fade gradually into the distance.
