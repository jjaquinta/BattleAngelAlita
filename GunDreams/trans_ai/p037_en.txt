"Now, the question is whether I can successfully thaw her out from this state..."

Ido recalled once reading a clinical report from a facility about reviving someone from plastination. That report had been part of a massive accumulation of medical data, dating back around a hundred years. He remembered thinking, "I never thought that special knowledge would prove useful now..."

Ido touched the mark on his forehead. It was a symbol where the upper part of a circle was cut into a square shape, the emblem Ido had received back in his homeland.

He cleared his throat and shook his head, then busied himself once again, moving around the operating room. A full day had passed since Ido brought the girl into the operating room. He hadnâ€™t rested even once, completely focused on her. Of course, the cybernetic clinic had been closed during the day.

Ido had changed into his worn-out white coat and now sat by the side of the still-sleeping girl.
