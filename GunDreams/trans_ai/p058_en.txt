Gally held her nose and looked up. Before her stood a bull-like figure with a steel head, deliberately puffing out his chest.

"â€¦I-I'm sorry."

"Oh, you think 'sorry' is enough, you tough Scrapyard baby?! That hit just crushed my delicate heart, oh!"

The bull-headed man, clutching his steel chest plate with both arms, snorted fiercely as he ranted. Gally, seeing the bull-head cracking his fingers as he approached, slowly backed away, sitting down in confusion, trembling. She darted her eyes around, seeking help, but not a single person who had seen the situation stepped forward to help Gally. Some smiled with irresponsible curiosity, others walked away disinterested, while a few pretended not to notice and just watched.

"Come on, baby, what am I going to do with you... S-somebody..."

But not a single person who had witnessed the situation stepped forward to help Gally. Some laughed with an irresponsible gaze of curiosity, while others lost interest and walked away.
