As her distant screams gradually faded, Ido let out a quiet breath. He glanced around at the street, where several bloodstains bloomed like flowers, with the woman’s body and her severed left arm scattered on the ground.

"One of them got away, huh," Ido muttered coldly, adjusting the brim of his black leather hat.
