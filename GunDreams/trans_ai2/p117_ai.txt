Calico lit the cigarette held between her lips and asked Ido. He didn't answer for a while, stroking Gally's hair, but then suddenly began to speak as if to himself.

"I don't know much about Panzer Kunst either. But I've heard that it's a legendary martial art that was destroyed because it was terrifyingly powerful. That's probably why it's called the ancient Martian martial art."

By now, that fact has been long forgotten, but in the past space age, humanity reached Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, building unique cultures on each planet. Among them, especially the Martian Panzer Kunst wielded tremendous power in wars through assassinations and guerrilla warfare, and was feared as "On Mars, there is Panzer Kunst."

"Heh, I see... Indeed, the principles are quite different from our Earth-style martial arts. Even watching those moves, I can't imagine the battlefield is limited to the ground, you know," Calico said.

Calico walked over to Gally, who was held by Ido, gently placed her hand on the girl's cheek, and smiled as if praising her brave fight. However, that smile gave Ido a chilling sense of unease. Contrary to the mask of her smile, her eyes harbored a golden light filled with the instinctive hostility of a woman's jealousy hidden within.
