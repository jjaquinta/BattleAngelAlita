"Nooooooo!" He let out a feral roar as he ran towards the burning building, ignoring the flames licking at the entrance.

"Hey, that's crazy!"  
"It's already too late!" Some of the onlookers shouted at him as they watched the inferno, but by the time they spoke, Norinco had already charged into the fire, disappearing from view.

"I’ll save you, my child!" he cried, ignoring the searing heat that was already beginning to scorch his body. With swift movements, he darted up the crumbling staircase, reaching the third floor where his room was. The hallway on that floor was engulfed in the fiercest flames.

There was no doubt in his mind—the boy he had spared had set this fire, targeting him.
