She had used a technique. The surge of violent impulses and the pride in the skills she possessed arose instantly. Though it felt distant from her current self, there was a deep familiarity with the memory of battle. All of these thoughts filled Gally's mind, overwhelming her to the point where the intensity made her brain feel like it was heating up, ready to boil over. *To think that discovering just a fragment of who I once was would feel this intense...* Gally was caught between awe and confusion as waves of fear and joy surged through her heart. 

Before she could calm her rising emotions, a sharp, blade-like killing intent closed in on her from behind. "That's some impressive skill, young lady," came a chilling voice, as the aura of impending violence crept over Gally like a shroud. Freezing in terror, Gally instinctively threw herself forward, rolling to gain distance before turning to face her attacker.

"You...!" Gally's entire body tingled with an electrifying sensation, as if her skin was bristling from an unseen threat. She narrowed her gaze, locking onto the figure who had just tried to kick her. But the figure, strangely calm, had no trace of killing intent, staring back at Gally with a somewhat vacant expression.
