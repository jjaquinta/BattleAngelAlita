Shigu said this as she pulled out a knife from her pocket. The blade of the knife emitted a dark metallic sheen, almost reminiscent of reptile skin. Shigu licked the blade and then slowly advanced toward Gally.

"So, this Ido guy is a damn serial killer, isn't he, Gally?"

"No, Ido would neverâ€”you're wrong! You're all wrong! I don't understand what you're saying!" Gally shook her head violently as she spoke. A chill ran down her spine, and despite gasping for breath, her mind felt oxygen-deprived, as if her artificial lungs were malfunctioning, causing her vision to blur.

"We're going to find that Ido bastard and make him pay. I've already spent a fortune to hire a top-class Hunter for that. Gally, you're just the right offering. We'll tear you apart as a message to him," Shigu declared.

The blade in Shigu's raised hand caught a faint glimmer of light, reflecting Gally's terror-stricken face like a mirror.

"Time to die, Gally."
