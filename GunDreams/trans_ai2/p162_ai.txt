The old man's eyes still held a glimmer of light, and his black hair resembled a mane.

"Kyahhh!" "Hiiiii, it's... a Hunter!"

The underground room was the hideout of the Spine Robbery Gang. Norinco, after three months of searching the town like a bloodhound, had finally discovered this hideout. Kicking down the door, Norinco, with his wild black hair, leaped upon the bounty heads like an agile predator. Even those armed, or with cyborg bodies, were caught off guard and fell helplessly before the "Mantis Kung Fu." Sliding forward in a low stance, his sharp hand strikes sent the bounty heads sinking into a sea of blood and flesh.

It hadn't even been five minutes since Norinco had invaded the hideout. The dozen or so bounty heads were all cut down, lying cold on the floor, filling the air with the strong stench of blood. Norinco, drenched in the bloodied sea, flashed a fierce smile as he walked away from the corpses, one after another.
