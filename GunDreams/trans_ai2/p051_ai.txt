When Gally naturally walked over, balancing a tray with a water jug, Gonzu was just getting up from the living room table.

"Oh, Gonzu, are you leaving already?" Gally asked.

Gonzu, quite drunk and swaying a little, nodded with his wrinkled, flushed face. "Yeah, if I drink any more here, I’ll end up staying over. I'll continue at my apartment."

"I don’t mind if you stay, Gonzu," Ido said, resting his elbow on the table, having lightly shared some drinks with Gonzu. But Gonzu laughed and shook his head.

"Heh, I know well enough that you don't like that sort of thing. Don't worry about it. See you later."

After Gally saw off the drunken Gonzu as he staggered out, she returned to the living room to find Ido stretching out with a big yawn.
