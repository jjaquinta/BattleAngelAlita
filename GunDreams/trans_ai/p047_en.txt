“Did two escape?”
Ido muttered in a cold voice, pulling his black leather hat down low over his face.
As the woman's screams grew fainter and more distant, Ido let out a small sigh. The road he looked around at was dotted with flowers of blood, with the woman's corpse and her left arm lying on the ground.
