Gally didn’t even know how to become a Hunter, leaving her feeling lost. She sat down on a pile of old monitors at the edge of the street and let out a deep sigh. “What should I do now…”

At that moment, someone placed a hand on her shoulder with a soft pat.

“…We meet again,” a voice said.

“Shig?”

When Gally looked up, she saw the plump, tanuki-faced woman, Shig. Scratching her head awkwardly, Shig gave a small bow to Gally.

"Yeah, sorry about yesterday. I had no idea your friend was a Hunter. I found out from Kyariko—what a big mistake, huh?"

As Gally watched the sheepish Shig scratching her head, the once lost and wandering Gally now saw her shining like a beacon. To Gally, Shig appeared as a goddess of salvation. Without thinking, Gally hugged Shig tightly.

“There, there,” Shig said.
