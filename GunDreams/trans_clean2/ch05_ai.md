# CHAPTER 5

Tempest Street stretched out before her, cloaked in the night’s shadow. Shig, a middle-aged woman hardened by her years, walked alone, her thoughts simmering beneath the surface.

“I hope that man Ido truly understands Alita,” she muttered, her voice lost to the wind.

She had left Ido Daisuke’s clinic with Calico’s message, informing him that Alita had become a Hunter. Now, with her errand complete, she was left alone to navigate the desolate streets. Ido's brusque dismissal replayed in her mind.

“I have preparations to make. You may return now,” he had said before shutting the door in her face. Shig, accustomed to such coldness, shrugged it off. After all, Calico hadn’t requested her company beyond the message delivery. Alone once more, Shig turned toward the maze of alleyways that would lead her back to the Pleasure District.

The air was still as she entered a narrow alley, barely a meter wide, winding and twisting like a labyrinth. Darkness smothered the passage, broken only by the distant flicker of neon lights at the alley’s end. Despite the shadows and the suffocating tightness of the walls, this was a shortcut she knew well. A few minutes through this path, and she’d reach the district. The main roads would take twice as long.

But tonight, the alley felt different. Unfamiliar. She stopped. A sound—faint at first—began to echo off the dirty brick walls. A low, rasping friction. The noise of something large, something unseen, brushing against the alley’s edges.

“What is that sound?” Shig whispered, her hand instinctively reaching for a weapon she did not possess.

She quickened her pace, the sound following her, scraping against the alley’s confines. It slithered closer with each step, an ominous presence that set her nerves on fire. The feeling of being hunted gripped her spine, cold sweat forming on her brow.

Her pace turned into a run. Left. Right. Straight ahead. The alley twisted in all directions, each corner sharp and unforgiving. She moved without thought, guided only by instinct and desperation. Behind her, the friction grew louder, closer.

“Ah…” Shig gasped, her voice thin and terrified.

Then, ahead, a flicker of light. Small, but enough to break the darkness.

Relief flooded her veins. The end of the alley, so close now. She stumbled toward it, her breath ragged, her limbs trembling from the chase. The light was almost within reach—

Elsewhere, Calico stood silently, lighting a cigarette as she glanced at Ido. He remained silent for a moment, his fingers gently stroking Alita’s hair as if in contemplation. When he finally spoke, his words came out in a low, thoughtful murmur.

“I don’t know much about Panzer Kunst… but I’ve heard whispers. It’s more than a martial art. It was a way of life on Mars—a legend, destroyed because it became too powerful. They say it was feared across the solar system.”

His voice trailed off as if he were trying to recall fragments of a forgotten time. “In the old age, humanity spread across Venus, Mars, even Jupiter. Each planet forged its own culture, its own wars. But on Mars... Panzer Kunst was a force of destruction. It wasn’t just combat—it was assassination, guerrilla warfare. A technique that transcended the battlefield.”

Calico took a drag from her cigarette, the glow illuminating her face. “I can see why,” she said. “It’s nothing like the martial arts of Earth. Watching her use it... I can’t imagine the kind of war that art was born from.”

Her eyes shifted toward Alita, sleeping peacefully in Ido’s arms. She stepped forward, her fingers brushing against the girl’s cheek with a tender, almost motherly affection. But something simmered beneath Calico’s smile—something dangerous. Ido saw it, the flash of golden light in her eyes, a predator’s gleam, masked beneath the warmth of her touch.

He stiffened, his instincts screaming a warning. “Calico… you…”

His voice was strained, heavy with realization. He moved, positioning himself between Alita and the woman before him. His back straightened, his tone darkening. “I won’t let you near her again. I can see it in your eyes. If you and Alita remain close… one day, you’ll try to kill each other.”

For a moment, Calico stood still, her eyes locked on Ido’s. The air between them was thick with unspoken tension. Then, slowly, her lips curled into a dry, humorless chuckle. She turned away, walking toward the shadowed alley without so much as a backward glance.

“Maybe you’re right,” she called over her shoulder, her voice cold, detached. “She’s a cute kid… but I think I’ve just started to dislike her. Tell her not to come looking for me.”

Her footsteps faded into the darkness, the sound swallowed by the city. Ido watched her leave, his body rigid with unease. He understood now. Calico was too proud, too strong. She would never allow anyone—especially someone like Alita—to threaten her place. If Alita continued to grow, to surpass her…

He sighed, glancing down at the girl in his arms. It was inevitable. They were bound by fate, two warriors on a path that would one day force them to collide.

As Calico disappeared into the city’s night, Ido adjusted Alita in his arms and began the walk home. His thoughts churned, dark and brooding. After a few steps, he stopped, glancing back toward the alley where Calico had vanished. The darkness yawned before him, empty and silent.

“Calico’s jealousy… her strength… they’re more dangerous than Colt’s obsession. I should have stopped her here and now.”

He clenched his fist, the weight of his helplessness settling over him like a shroud. But deep down, he knew he didn’t have the strength to kill her. Not yet.
