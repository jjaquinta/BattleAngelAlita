In response to Gally's words, Bergman frowned and pursed his lips before snorting and confidently replying, "You think I can't handle this? I may be a retired ball player, but swapping bodies is a piece of cake for me. Sure, I just picked it up by watching machine engineers, but I've done all the body swaps in this shop myself."

Although Bergman's words initially made Gally feel a little uneasy, he quickly and skillfully completed the body swap. "Wow... you're even faster than Ido," Gally murmured, genuinely impressed as she looked over her new body, which was unpainted and purely metallic in appearance. 

"How's it feel? Any problems or discomfort?" Bergman asked. Gally threw a couple of kicks to test it out, and sure enough, the response was leagues beyond her previous civilian model. The neural and mechanical systems were on a completely different level. Previously, she'd sometimes felt a sense of heaviness or awkwardness in her movements, but with this new body, there was almost no weight to hold her back.

"Thanks, Bergman. I love it!" Gally said, her excitement evident.
