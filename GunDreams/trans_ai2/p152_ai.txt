The man approached Gally with an unsteady gait, sneering as he moved closer. Still a bit scared. Do I still not trust myself? Damn it, I’m strong enough. I beat that Colt guy, didn’t I? Gally tried to shake off her hesitation, mentally urging herself on, but Ido's voice echoed in her mind. "Gally, you're still less than half a Hunter..."

"Damn it! Don’t underestimate me! I’m a Hunter!" Gally shouted, sharply exhaling as she forced her fear aside. She darted forward, weaving around tables and bodies as she charged at the man worth 60,000 chips, who staggered drunkenly.

"Ha ha ha! A Hunter, you say? This little girl?!" the man slurred, his voice filled with mockery. Though clearly high and unsteady, his anger flared as Gally quickly closed the gap. With a powerful swing of his curved blade, powered by his cyborg arm, he slashed at her. 

Gally ducked under the sweeping blade, lowering her head to avoid the strike, then planted her right hand on the floor as she kicked her left leg upward. Using her hand as a pivot, Gally twisted her body, executing a cartwheel-like motion. Her heel came up from below, in a sweeping arc, aimed at the man’s temple from his blind spot.
