"Heh heh, with this many bounties, I should be able to pay off some of my debt and even buy some children's clothes," Norinco thought, eagerly awaiting the birth of his long-desired child. The tender image of parenthood, something he had dreamed of as a young orphan, had always seemed like a fantasy in this harsh reality. Not knowing his own parents had left him with a deep yearning for that connection. His desire to have his own child was especially strong. When he was around ten years old, an accident had left him with a fully cybernetic body, causing him to lose his reproductive organs. Determined to have a child, Norinco spent 50 million chips on a special fertilization procedure for his wife.

The procedure was a cutting-edge method that extracted DNA from brain cells and fused it with the DNA from an egg. The result was not a clone but a pure descendant that carried the genetic legacy of both parents. As Norinco prepared to leave the hellish underground chamber, with the bodies of numerous bounty heads hanging from his waist and hands, a heavy thud echoed behind him. When he turned around, he saw a boy, about ten years old, who had been hiding behind a pillar. The boy had dropped the knife he was holding."
