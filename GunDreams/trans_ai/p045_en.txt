Long shadows stretched into the alley, dancing at Ido’s feet as he hid against the wall. It was the woman accompanying him.
Ido calmly reached into his left pocket and pulled out a chip. With a ping, the chip rolled onto the alley floor. It bounced along like a wheel and fell over sideways in the women's line of sight as they walked.
The moment the chip, clad in a black silhouette in the moonlight, shone in the alley, the two women’s eyes opened wide.
"Kigue!"
Both women screamed simultaneously and dashed toward the crossroad where the chip rolled, like monkeys. Their arms reached for the chip at the same time. In that instant, all the tension in their bodies and the ferocious energy they had held in was released. Ido, with his dark form, leaped into the moonlight and yelled, "Kuooh!"
