"A heating battery cartridge, this one."

Saying that, the woman pocketed the roughly ten-centimeter-long cartridge that had been ejected.

"So, you used that thing on my wrist too?"

There had been a mystery to the womanâ€™s kick. A high-speed kick had ejected an electric heating blade from her leg, slicing through her enemy with the heat of the blade and the force of the impact. In order to heat the blade sufficiently, it required preheating, and the cartridge-based battery had a limited number of uses. This was a drawback, but the effect as a concealed weapon and the power from the heat were formidable threats to anyone on the receiving end. The increased reach of the kick was another significant advantage.

"Well, if we keep this up any longer, it's going to interfere with my work tomorrow, so sorry, but I'll be taking your head now."

The woman said casually, lifting her plump red lips into a smile. That snake-like smile made the man's body shudder involuntarily.

"P-please, spare me!"
