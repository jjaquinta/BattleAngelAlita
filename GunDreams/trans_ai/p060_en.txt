The bull-headed man's direct punch cut through the air and struck a passing cyborg by accident. "Fuck!!" The unlucky passing cyborg was struck in the torso by the bull-headed man’s vertical fist, bending in half. While the cyborg was crumpling, Gally slipped under the bull-headed man's arm and dashed away. "Ughh..." With a crack, the cyborg’s artificial spine snapped and flew out, scattering fluid around. "Shit, did she get away, baby?" As the bull-headed man turned around with rough breaths, Gally had already disappeared into the crowd. "Hey, hey, little lady, wait up. Come here!" Gally was rolling away, escaping from the bull-headed man. She weaved her way through the bustling crowd, running.
