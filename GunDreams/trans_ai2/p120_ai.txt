Calmly shifting her tactics from defensive to offensive, Calico spoke in a low, deliberate voice. "Come out, you murderer of prostitutes. I know you're there, aren't you?" She sent out a wave of killing intent into the darkness, probing for the presence of whoever was hiding there. The density of her killing intent was enough to make most people faint as if struck by lightning or rush at her in a panic. But there was no response from the shadows, not even a hint of a breeze.

The eerie presence lurking in the dimness absorbed Calico's intent like a reed bending to the wind, unaffected and utterly silent. Calico's eyes narrowed as she tried to gauge the strength of this invisible opponent, who was watching her like a phantom. Who is this? she wondered.

After a brief pause, as though it had grown bored of the silence, the figure began to move. From the darkness behind Shig's collapsed form, a steel hand quietly slithered out. Only the long, thin fingers of a cyborg hand emerged from the shadows, reaching out without a sound, casually grabbing hold of Shig's hair.
