"My knives have been underestimated, huh? You think a flimsy wooden shield will stop me?!" The man, using the full power of his cyborg arm, hurled his knives with such force that they could easily pierce through two and a half centimeters of steel. With a cruel smile, he launched all eight knives toward the round table where Gally was hiding. The knives flew at incredible speed, striking the table and tearing it apart as if it were tissue paper.

"You little brat, calling yourself a Hunter! You think you can get away with that?!" He spat in anger as he approached the spot where the table had been, intending to stomp on Gallyâ€™s remains. But when he got there, all he saw were shattered wooden pieces. No body, not even a trace of a cyborg arm.

"Up here, you idiot!" He looked up in a panic, cold sweat running down his face, only to find Gally hanging from the ceiling pipes. She had jumped to the ceiling at the last moment, avoiding the knives that destroyed the table.

"Damn brat!" the man roared, his face twisting with rage as he began to hurl knives wildly at her, trying to hit his elusive target.
