Calico rummaged through the inside pocket of her coat and confirmed it, clicking her tongue softly. In the earlier fight, she had used three cartridges, including the pre-heating rounds, of the red-hot power supply. The "Red Heat Leg" was a gimmick designed to exert destructive power through the high heat generated by an internal electric blade, but its weakness was that the special steel blade cooled down quickly, making it difficult to maintain a high temperature. To use it, pre-heating was necessary, and to expect full power, she would need more battery cartridges. However, with only one cartridge left, she had no choice but to rely on the residual heat from when it was last used in the battle with Colt's gang.

Taking a deep breath and steeling herself, Calico finished loading the last cartridge. As the tension in the air heightened, her soaked body trembled with a fearless laugh. With subtle movements that were almost imperceptible, she lightly shifted her stance by opening her legs just slightly forward and backward. This was all she could do for now.

Just then, another clap of thunder roared, and with it, a thick, blue lightning bolt filled with intense energy cut through the sky.
