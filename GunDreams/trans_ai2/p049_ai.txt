She had been practicing diligently for this moment. "Okay, I’m coming," Gally said, putting strength into her machine arms. She pressed down on the wheelchair's armrests, lifting her body up. 

"That's it, you can do it, Gally!" Ido cheered, his fists clenched in excitement. As Gally hesitantly tried to take her first step, Ido instinctively took a step forward as well. Gally carefully lowered one foot to the ground, as if testing the surface of water, while holding onto the back of the wheelchair. Then, she slowly placed her other foot down. 

"I... Ido..." Gally’s face reflected both fear and determination as she hesitantly reached out a hand toward Ido and began walking slowly. Seeing her, Ido broke into a wide smile, unable to contain himself. He stepped toward Gally, whose movements were still slightly awkward, and embraced her tightly.
