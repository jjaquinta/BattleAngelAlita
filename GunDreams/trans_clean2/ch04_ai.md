### Chapter 4

"Hey... come on, wake up already."

A distant voice pierced through the fog of Gally's unconsciousness, pulling her back to reality. When she opened her eyes, a red-haired woman with an unsettling smile was peering down at her.

"Where... am I?" Gally murmured.

She realized she was lying on the rooftop of a building. The woman had carried her up here.

The red-haired woman stood at the edge of the rooftop, where there were no fences or barriers, gazing down at the city below. "Take a look. It's quite something, don’t you think?"

With a quiet chuckle, she motioned for Gally to join her. Though slightly annoyed at being commanded, Gally couldn't suppress her curiosity. She approached the edge and peered over.

"Ah, that's... Ido..."

About ten meters below, at a small intersection of alleyways, a familiar figure lurked in the shadows. It was Ido, dressed in his usual black attire, leaning against the wall with a large trunk case by his side—the same one Gally had seen when he'd slipped out earlier.

Ido cradled an abnormally large hammer, its tip sharply pointed—clearly not meant for any ordinary task.

"What... what is Ido planning to do?" Gally whispered, a mix of suspicion and concern knotting in her stomach.

Faint footsteps echoed from the darkness of the alley. A silhouette, seemingly of a woman, began to emerge toward the intersection where Ido waited, unnoticed.

Ido pressed his ear against the wall, his body tense. As the woman passed by, he stepped out silently, his hammer poised.

"No... you can't, Ido!" Gally gasped.

The red-haired woman beside her wore a gleeful smile, savoring the unfolding scene.

Just as Gally reached out, her voice caught in her throat. Ido's hammer came crashing down, shattering the woman's skull with a sickening crunch. The sound echoed eerily, like an insect being crushed underfoot.

Gally watched in horror as Ido stood over the lifeless body, a faint smile playing on his lips. He stepped on the flattened remains, freeing them from the hammerhead, and carefully placed the mangled head into a burlap sack.

"Hehe... shocked, aren't you?" whispered the red-haired woman, crouching beside Gally.

Gally sat frozen, her mind reeling. The woman sighed. "Oh dear... maybe I went a little too far with the fun."

She shook Gally gently, lightly slapping her cheeks. "Snap out of it. That was nothing—just a Hunter-Warrior doing his job."

Gradually, clarity returned to Gally's eyes.

"Ido isn't a serial killer; he's a Hunter-Warrior who hunts down criminals," the woman explained.

Gally blinked, her voice trembling. "A Hunter-Warrior? But he just... killed that woman."

The red-haired woman nodded. "She was on the bounty list. One of the notorious mutant sisters, Asnas. A murderer. The bounty on her head was a modest 32,000 chips."

She handed Gally a printout of the bounty list. Gally exhaled a long sigh of relief.

"Feeling better now? Ido's one of the decent ones. He doesn't take on bodyguard gigs like I do. He only hunts small fry on the side. Still, he's doing alright," the woman continued.

Gally now understood the truth: Ido was working as a Hunter-Warrior to earn money, likely to repair her body. The woman also mentioned that body parts were acquired cheaply from corpse recovery dealers.

"Honestly, you were taking everything Shig and the others said so seriously, I couldn't resist messing with you a little," she added with a smirk.

"Your name is... Calico, right?" Gally asked.

"That's me," the red-haired woman replied, lighting a cigarette and exhaling a plume of purple smoke.

"By the way, Gally, where did you learn that technique?" Calico inquired.

Gally gave a wry smile. "I don't really know. Ido found me and brought me back to life. I still don't understand much about myself."

The martial arts techniques that had surged from deep within her were fading back into the fog of her lost memories.

"Hey, Calico, do you think we'll meet again sometime?" Gally asked suddenly.

Calico scratched her head, her gaze drifting into the night sky. She flicked her cigarette away. Without looking back, she disappeared into the maze of the entertainment district.

"Will I make it home before Ido gets back?" Gally wondered aloud.

She ran through the dark alleys. By the time she returned home, Ido hadn't yet arrived. He likely had to stop by the Factory to cash in the bounty.

---

The next morning felt surreal, as if the events of the previous night had been a dream. So much had happened so quickly. Gally felt drained, her thoughts a whirlwind of confusion.

"What happened, Gally? Your body's all dented and scratched," Ido said, concern etched on his face as he tightened the bolts on her maintenance hatch.

"No problem with your internal organs, but one of your joints is a little misaligned. Did something happen?"

"Uh, no, nothing... I just tripped. Sorry, it's nothing serious," Gally replied, her mind elsewhere.

Her thoughts were consumed by the battle with Calico, the fleeting sense of fulfillment she’d felt, the strange exhilaration when fragments of her past resurfaced.

"Are you sure? You seem... distracted," Ido pressed gently.

Gally forced a smile. "I'm fine, really. Just lost in thought."

Ido sensed her reluctance but decided not to push further. "Alright, if you say so."

But tension hung between them, unspoken and heavy.

That night, Gally gathered her courage. "Ido, I want to become a Hunter-Warrior," she confessed.

Ido's reaction was immediate. "What? No! That's nonsense! You can't become a Hunter-Warrior!"

Gally met his gaze, her eyes filled with determination. "I've started to remember things—combat techniques. By putting myself in battle, I can reclaim pieces of who I was."

Ido shook his head vehemently. "But that's not why I brought you back. You don't understand how ugly and dirty battle really is."

As he turned away, Gally's voice rose. "I know, Ido! I know you're a Hunter-Warrior! If fighting is so terrible, why are you doing it?"

He froze. "You... you knew?"

She stepped closer. "I realized how much danger you put yourself in for me. I can't let you face it alone."

Ido's shoulders slumped. "For your sake, I'd gladly sever any criminal's head. But... I want you to remain my dream."

"Ido..." Gally whispered, her heart aching.

"I just want to make you into something beautiful," he said, his voice strained.

Gally shook her head gently. "I'm sorry, Ido... but I can't be your dress-up doll."

She turned and left, leaving Ido alone with his unspoken sorrows.

---

Gally wandered the bustling streets of the entertainment district, aimless and lost. Should she really pursue becoming a Hunter-Warrior? She didn't even know how to begin.

Sitting on a pile of discarded monitors, she sighed. "What should I do now?"

A hand rested on her shoulder.

"We meet again," a familiar voice said.

"Shig?"

Gally looked up to see the plump, friendly face of Shig. Scratching her head, Shig gave a small bow.

"Sorry about yesterday. I had no idea your friend was a Hunter. Big mistake, huh?"

Gally felt a surge of relief. Without thinking, she hugged Shig tightly.

"There, there," Shig said with a chuckle.

"Can you help me?" Gally asked, her voice barely above a whisper.

"Of course," Shig replied warmly.

---

Shig led Gally to a back entrance of one of The Scrapyard's top cabarets in the eastern district.

"Does Calico live here?" Gally asked.

Shig laughed softly. "Calico? She doesn't have a proper home. She works all over the entertainment district. You could say the whole place is her home."

They navigated through grimy alleys, arriving at a dressing room.

"Hey, it's me, Shig!" she called, knocking on the door.

After a moment, the door opened slightly. "What do you want?" Calico's eyes narrowed.

"Calico, Gally wants to become a Hunter. She came to ask for your help," Shig explained.

Calico sighed, lighting a cigarette. "You sure about this, Gally?"

Gally nodded earnestly. "I have nowhere else to turn. I don't know anything about this city or how to become a Hunter-Warrior. Please teach me."

Calico studied her for a long moment. Finally, she exhaled a plume of smoke. "Alright. I'll show you how to register."

"Thank you," Gally said, relief washing over her.

---

They left the entertainment district, heading toward the Factory—a massive structure that loomed over The Scrapyard, connecting to the aerial city of Zalem via a thick, ivory-colored pipe stretching into the sky.

"Is it really this easy to become a Hunter-Warrior?" Gally asked, rubbing her head. The registration process had been surprisingly simple—a laser imprinting an identification code onto her brain.

"Becoming one is easy," Calico replied. "But making a name for yourself? That's the hard part."

"I don't really understand what it means to 'make money' yet..." Gally admitted.

Calico smirked. "You'll learn soon enough."

As they approached the entrance to the entertainment district, a group of men emerged from the shadows, surrounding them.

"Out at this hour? Sorry for being such villains," a voice sneered.

"What's the meaning of this?" Calico demanded, flicking her cigarette aside.

A towering, fully cyberized man stepped forward—a steel bull-like face gleaming in the dim light.

"Remember me, baby?" he growled.

"You're... Colt," Gally whispered.

"Didn't think you'd forget," Colt replied arrogantly.

Calico tensed. "What do you want?"

Colt grinned. "Just a little revenge. And maybe some fun."

Ten men closed in, weapons gleaming.

Calico glanced at Gally. "Stay close."

Colt laughed. "Think you can take us all?"

Calico's eyes hardened. "Try me."

---

The alley erupted into chaos.

Calico moved like lightning, her red-hot thermal blade slicing through the air. In seconds, five men lay crumpled at her feet.

Gally watched in awe and horror as Calico dispatched two more with ruthless efficiency.

Colt snarled. "Impressive. But I'm not so easily beaten."

He charged at Gally, his massive frame barreling forward.

Gally's heart pounded. She tried to recall the combat techniques buried deep within her.

"Focus..." she whispered.

Colt's fist swung toward her like a wrecking ball.

At the last moment, Gally sidestepped, the memory of a martial arts move flashing in her mind. She countered with a swift kick, but it barely phased him.

He laughed. "That all you got?"

He swung again, and this time, Gally couldn't dodge in time. The impact sent her skidding across the pavement.

"Gally!" Ido's voice echoed as he arrived, his hammer raised.

"Stay back!" Calico shouted, holding him back. "She needs to do this."

Gally pushed herself up, blood trickling from her lip.

"Come on," she told herself. "Remember."

Colt charged once more.

Gally closed her eyes, letting go of conscious thought. The world seemed to slow. When she opened her eyes, a calm settled over her.

Colt's fist hurtled toward her, but this time, she moved with fluid grace. She dodged, weaving under his arm, and struck a precise blow to his elbow joint.

There was a sharp crack.

"Argh!" Colt bellowed, clutching his damaged arm.

Gally didn't hesitate. She spun and delivered a powerful kick to his head. Colt staggered back, dazed.

"Impossible..." he muttered.

Gally stood firm. "This ends now."

With a final burst of speed, she leaped into the air, descending upon him with a devastating strike. The impact shattered Colt's cybernetic body, pieces scattering across the alley.

Silence fell.

Ido stared in disbelief. Calico smirked, impressed.

Gally landed softly, her strength spent. "I... remember now," she whispered before collapsing.

---

When Gally awoke, she was back in Ido's workshop. His worried face hovered above her.

"You're awake," he said softly.

"Ido... I'm sorry," Gally murmured.

He shook his head. "No. I'm the one who's sorry. I should have trusted you."

She reached out and took his hand. "Thank you... for believing in me."

He smiled gently. "You were incredible out there."

Gally nodded. "I know who I am now. Or at least, part of me."

"That's all that matters," Ido replied.

From the doorway, Calico leaned against the frame. "Seems like everything worked out."

Gally met her gaze. "Thank you, Calico."

She waved a dismissive hand. "Don't mention it. Just keep surviving."

Gally smiled. "I will."

---

The wind whispered through The Scrapyard, carrying with it the promise of new beginnings. Gally stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the sprawling city.

Her journey was just beginning.
