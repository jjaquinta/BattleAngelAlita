As Gally quietly ate her late breakfast, which was more like lunch at this point, Ido entered the dining room, rolling his neck and shoulders as he spoke. However, her response was hesitant and unenthusiastic. “Well, um, tonight… I kind of…”

Gally was feeling tired from her activities the previous night, but more than that, she declined Ido’s offer out of a subtle sense of rebellion. After all, she had taken down two bounty heads on her own just the day before.

Ido noticed her attitude and furrowed his brow, looking at her with a somewhat disappointed gaze. “What’s the matter, Gally? You were so interested in hunter work. Don’t tell me you’ve already lost interest?”

Gally shook her head quickly in response and, after finishing her meal, stood up from the table. “Sorry, that’s not it… I just don’t feel up to it tonight. But I promise I’ll go next time.”

With that, Gally hurriedly left the dining room and bolted out of the house. Ido stood frozen for a moment, as if trying to call her back, but after a while, he let out a sigh and slumped slightly, feeling drained.
