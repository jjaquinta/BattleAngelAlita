Belchere didn’t let her expression darken in the slightest at Norinco's hesitant words. Instead, she gave him a smile as radiant as a flower. Then, she sat up halfway in bed and gently wrapped her arms around his back, pulling him close.

"That’s perfectly fine with me. I never imagined I could find any meaning in life during those days of hardship. But you gave me the precious duty of bringing a child into this world. That alone makes me incredibly happy now. ...Norinco, I’m truly glad to be alive."

Norinco, in turn, wrapped his arms around her back and embraced her. Then, raising his face, he offered her a rare smile and said, "Belchere, I will always take pride in the fact that I am having a child with you."

After that, Norinco slowly stepped away from the bed and grabbed the bounty heads neatly lined up on the table.

"For the sake of our child, who will likely be born tomorrow, I need to turn these bounty heads into chips. I have to hire the doctor and midwives first thing in the morning."
