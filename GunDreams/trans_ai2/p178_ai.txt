"Look, if you keep this up, you're going to end up in a situation you can't come back from!"
Gally fell silent at those words, biting her lip even harder.
"Well then, what should I do if some sleazy guy attacks me, huh, Ido?"
Ido, unable to contain his frustration at Gally's words, slammed his fist hard against the wall and yelled at her.
"You run away."
Gally, offended by that, glared at Ido and responded in a sharp tone.
"I don't want to do that. That's just cowardly!"
"And that's exactly why I can't let you be a Hunter on your own! Have you ever thought about how I feel when you come back hurt? Until you fix that impulsiveness of yours, there's no way I can let you be a Hunter!"
Gally was stung by Ido's harsh words, but she retorted, matching his intensity.
"Fine, whatever!"
But deep down, Gally knew she wanted Ido to acknowledge that she could be a great Hunter on her own.
