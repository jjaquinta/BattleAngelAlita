"Wh-what the heck is going on?"

After a few seconds, the knife attached as an extra to his gripped left hand finally fell spinning rapidly beside the man and stuck into the alley's asphalt.

The shadow did not avoid the man's knife, which was being swung down at high speed; instead, it swept a kick across the wrist holding the knife from the side at a speed far exceeding that.

That shadow's kick was truly a work of art. It was a kicking technique with a supple movement like a waterfowl spreading its wings to take flight to the sky, yet at the same time, it held the destructive power akin to a raptor's talons tearing apart its prey.

As the blade of the knife descended rapidly, the shadow's folded kicking leg extended almost straight upward like a whip. Then, lifting the heel of the supporting foot off the ground, pivoting sharply inward around the base of the big toe, the body turned to almost face forward.

As the kicking leg received the explosive force from the supporting leg that had risen onto tiptoe with the heel's rotation, the lower leg from the folded knee was released, twisting sharply inward. At this moment, the kick's power reached its maximum, impacting the man's left wrist that held the knife, severing it.
