# CHAPTER 6

Late that night, the towering lights of the aerial city Zalem, floating above the Scrapyard, vanished as thick, dark rain clouds crept in, swallowing the sky. The midnight bustle—a hallmark of the entertainment district in the northern part of town—quickly faded as people hurried to their shops and homes, the threat of an impending storm looming.

Calico, her clothes soaked by the first drops of rain, turned a familiar corner in the back alleys of the district. She expected the street to continue, but instead, she found herself facing a narrow path, barely a meter and a half wide, formed by the gaps between buildings. It was a shortcut—a dim, unlit route that would lead her to the back door of the Pink Cabaret in less than a minute.

As she approached the door, reaching for the knob, a faint sound echoed from the depths of the alley—a scraping noise, almost swallowed by the rain.

"...What's that?"

Calico squinted, trying to make out anything in the hazy, shadowed distance. The alley, a narrow space where neither streetlights nor neon glows reached, only allowed her to see ten meters ahead. For a moment, she wondered if it was just her imagination.

Then, a rumble of thunder shook the air, filling every corner of the alley. Thunderclouds gathered, and within seconds, a torrential downpour hammered down on Calico. The sound of rain drowned out the world around her, but she knew better than to ignore the unknown presence. Releasing her grip on the doorknob, she allowed her senses to sharpen, honing in on the darkness beyond, indifferent to the water running down her face.

Something was approaching. She couldn’t see it, but the tension in the air was palpable. Her animal-like instincts sensed it, and an unsettling unease crept into her chest. **Danger was close.**

She fixed her gaze on the shadows, and with a swift motion, lifted the hem of her soaked coat, revealing a dull steel gun, gleaming faintly in the rain. With a slow, deliberate pull of the bolt lever, she ejected the used battery cartridge from earlier. 

Calico clicked her tongue softly as she rummaged through her coat pocket. Three cartridges used already, leaving her with just one. Her Red Heat Leg, powered by an electric blade that generated immense heat, required pre-heating for full destructive potential, but with only one battery left, she would have to rely on the residual heat from her previous fight. It wasn’t ideal, but she had no choice.

She loaded the last cartridge, steeling herself as a fearless smirk played on her lips. Her soaked body trembled slightly, not from fear, but from the anticipation of the battle to come. With subtle movements, she shifted her stance, widening her legs slightly—this was all she could do for now.

Another crack of thunder rolled across the sky, followed by a searing blue lightning bolt that cut through the darkness. The brief flash illuminated the alley, and for a moment, Calico froze.

A figure stood in the distance—a woman, drenched in the relentless rain. Her skin glistened under the downpour, but it wasn’t her nudity that was grotesque. Her arms had been severed at the shoulders, blood streaming down her torso, pooling at her feet. A single slash ran down her chest to her navel, and her intestines, stained pink with blood, hung from her body like a macabre sash.

Yet somehow, despite the blood loss and the unimaginable pain, she remained alive, staggering forward with shallow, wheezing breaths.

"Sh—Shig?" Calico’s voice broke as she recognized the mutilated figure.

It was Shig—an old friend, a prostitute she had known for years. Shig had dragged her broken body to this place, perhaps in search of Calico, perhaps hoping for help. But there was no time for Calico to react. Shig collapsed, sliding down the blood-soaked alley wall and falling into a crumpled heap.

Calico stepped forward, her heart racing, but before she could reach Shig, a new sound emerged—a strange grinding noise from the darkness behind her fallen friend. Calico’s eyes flared with anger as she peered into the gloom. Something—or someone—was hiding in the shadows, just beyond the edge of visibility.

Calico’s body tensed. She crouched slightly, adjusting her weight from her back foot to the ball of her front foot. A subtle shift, sacrificing linear movement for the ability to strike fast. Though her face remained calm, her heart was a storm of emotions, carefully concealed behind a mask of readiness.

A low, deliberate voice escaped her lips, challenging the lurking presence. 

"Come out, you murderer of prostitutes. I know you're there, aren't you?"

Her words, thick with killing intent, cut through the rain and into the darkness. It was a tactic, a way to provoke, to draw out the enemy. But no one emerged. There wasn’t even a whisper of movement. The silence hung thick in the air, absorbing Calico’s threat like a reed bending under wind.

Then, slowly, the figure moved. A thin, skeletal hand—a cyborg hand—slithered out from the shadows, reaching for Shig’s hair. With terrifying ease, the unseen assailant lifted Shig’s broken body into the air, her blood dripping into the pooling water below.

Without warning, a surge of murderous energy burst forth from the shadows, crashing into Calico’s senses. In a flash, an angular figure struck from above, pivoting sharply mid-kick. The blow sliced clean through Shig’s torso.

"Aghh... oh no, how could you do this... so cruel..." Shig’s voice, broken and agonized, was silenced as her body split apart.

The figure of the attacker stepped into the light—a grotesque, elderly cyborg. His face was obscured by wild, matted white hair, only his twisted mouth visible beneath the rain. His body, a mismatched mess of cybernetics, moved with a strange grace. His left arm, a multi-jointed, segmented monstrosity, extended and contracted like a centipede’s legs.

"Shut up… I don’t mix personal feelings with my hunts, you hear?" Calico hissed, narrowing her eyes.

The old man clicked his tongue disapprovingly. "What a waste," he muttered, before grinning darkly. "Let’s see what you’ve got, eh?"

Calico and the old man, who introduced himself as Norinco, faced off. The rain poured between them, the alley narrowing, leaving no room for error. The tension was palpable as their bodies shifted like serpents preparing to strike.

Lightning lit up the sky as their fight began in earnest, Calico’s elegant kicks clashing with Norinco’s quick, evasive maneuvers. But no matter how fiercely she attacked, Norinco’s defenses held, his cyborg body barely scratched by her relentless blows.

"Come on! Fight back a little, will ya?" Calico taunted, frustration creeping into her voice.

But Norinco only laughed, his twisted mouth curling into a sneer. "You’re holding back," he hissed, mocking her. "Afraid of slipping on the wet ground? Your kicks are crying, girl."

Calico gritted her teeth, her rage bubbling beneath the surface. **This ends now.**

She had one last card to play—her Red Heat Leg. Drawing on the final reserves of power, the electric blade in her right leg began to glow, heating up despite the rain. This was her last chance.

"Hisss... go ahead, try to kill me if you can," Norinco sneered, sensing her resolve.

In a blur of motion, Calico launched herself forward, the red-hot blade extending as she aimed for Norinco’s head. The kick was perfect—fast, deadly, and precise. But at the last moment, Norinco drew a thick-bladed knife from his waist, blocking her attack. The impact sent sparks flying, the thermal blade melting through eighty percent of the knife, but not enough.

Norinco laughed, his grotesque form still standing. "You really impress me," he wheezed, "but in the face of my dissection knife… it didn’t amount to much."

Calico, out of power, out of options, was no match for the master of combat. Norinco closed in, his blows precise and devastating. Her last attempt to fight back was effortlessly countered, and with one swift strike to the jaw, she was rendered unconscious.

With a sadistic grin, Norinco lifted her limp body and pinned her against the wall with his razor-sharp, mechanical arm. "Cyborgs don’t scream in pain when you dismantle them, which is boring... but I'll take my time."

Barely conscious, Calico could do nothing as Norinco’s knife hacked through her body. Piece by piece, her cyborg frame was reduced to a tattered mess. In the end, she was left broken, her right arm and leg barely attached.

With the last of her strength, Calico dragged herself toward a tear in the metal fence. Norinco, watching in amusement, tossed a knife, but it only grazed her, pinning her to the ground. Summoning every ounce of willpower, she slipped through the gap and tumbled into the sewage river, disappearing into the raging current.

Norinco watched, his eerie wheezing fading into the storm.

"Sssh... your determination is admirable. But surviving that current? Now that would be a miracle."

The deep sewer river, swollen with rainwater, roared like a wild torrent, surging violently. Covered in his shaggy white hair, the twisted killer Norinco took a final glance before merging into the shadows of the rain-soaked alleyway, his eerie wheezing fading away into the storm.
