"You're Norinco, right? Are you okay?" Gally asked, concerned, as Norinco's face trembled slightly with recognition. Although Gally found this reaction a bit odd, she checked to ensure that Norinco wasn’t seriously hurt.

"Hey, who the hell are you?! You think just 'cause you’re a bit cute that I’ll let you get away with this?!" The thug, frustrated by Gally interrupting the beating, sneered at her, pulling out a knife from his pocket. Without a word, Gally grabbed the thug's knife and effortlessly bent the blade with a sharp twist. The man let out a terrified yelp before running off, and the women who had been cheering him on scattered like frightened insects into the crowd.

"Serves them right," Gally snorted, ready to leave when she suddenly felt the old man cling to her from behind.

"Oh, Breda! Even during the day, you're here to help me. What a kind child you are!" Norinco muttered.

"Wait, hold on! Norinco, I'm not Breda. I’m Gally!" she said, startled.
