...Could reclaiming the ancient martial art within herself also lead to a path of despair?

"…Gally, Norinco is hiding ahead, in the shadows of the scrap heap, you know."

It was at that moment. While Gally was walking through the maze of debris, lost in thought, she suddenly heard a voice from somewhere. It was a voice that she recognized.

"…Could it be… Calico? Calico, is that you? Where are you?"

As Gally looked around, searching, the woman appeared after a few moments.

“Gally, don’t sympathize with the enemy.”

“…Calico, your body…”

The figure that emerged from the shadow of the scrap pile was unmistakably Calico. However, her body no longer resembled her previous form at all. While her head was still that of the original Calico, from the neck down, her body had turned into a strange, inhuman cyborg resembling the shape of a spider.

"Heh heh heh… don’t worry about it, Gally. A cybernetic doctor picked me up when I was on the verge of death."
