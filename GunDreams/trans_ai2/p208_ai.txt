Norinco whispered in a barely audible voice, his trembling hand reaching out to touch Gally’s cheek as she held him. After a brief hesitation, she gently nuzzled her face against his in response. 

“Thank you, Father... I’m glad I was born,” Gally said softly. At her words, Norinco gave a faint spasm before he stopped moving entirely. In silence, Gally stood up, leaving the rubble behind as the setting sun cast long shadows. By the time the blue dusk had fully settled, light rain began to fall as she stood on the street, staring at the soft glow from a familiar window—her home.

The lights on the first floor, where Ido’s clinic was, had long gone out, signaling the end of the day’s consultations. Only the second floor, Ido’s room, remained illuminated. Dragging her battered body, Gally made her way to the streetlamp where she could still see the house. There, she collapsed, sitting beneath the light, knees pulled close to her chest.

“Gally... is that you?” 

Hearing the familiar voice, Gally, who had been resting her face against her knees in the misty rain, lifted her head with a start, her heart stirred.
