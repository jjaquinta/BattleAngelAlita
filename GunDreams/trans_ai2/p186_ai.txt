Gally shook off Norinco's grip, trying to explain, but the old man, with tears streaming from beneath the cloth covering his eyes, continued to call her "Breda, Breda."

"This is troublesome... Come on, enough already," Gally muttered, though normally she would have reacted more aggressively in a situation like this. However, a thought crossed her mind that made her hesitate. Norinco had once been a renowned Hunter. Perhaps, by pretending to be Breda, she could learn about the old man's legendary past as a Hunter. Her curiosity flickered, and Gally decided to tolerate the discomfort of being mistaken for someone else.

"Alright, I understand. Could you tell me your story, Norinco? Today, you can share it with... Breda," Gally said, sitting beside the Breda doll placed on the cart's seat.

"Sigh... I am a worthless person," Norinco said, addressing Gally as Breda. "I have no reason to keep living."
