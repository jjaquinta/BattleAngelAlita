Sig let out a short, sharp cry as she was caught in the blast of heat that suddenly emanated from Gally. It was as if a small girl had been caught in the gaze of a man-eating tiger suddenly appearing from the shadows. Sig staggered back, her legs giving way, and she collapsed onto the filthy street. The sound of her teeth chattering filled the air, and a foul stench of urine mixed with the smell of the alley as a dark stain slowly spread from where she sat. 

"Fuuuu..." Gally stood still, swaying slightly, as she slowly scanned the faces of Sig's companions. The other prostitutes were already frozen in fear, as though they had been turned into frogs under the gaze of a snake. They dropped their knives, trembling, their legs giving way as they hurriedly pulled Sig along and fled the alley. 

Left alone in the dim alley, Gally stood quietly, unmoving. "What... what is this feeling?" Gally whispered, trying to stop the trembling that was spreading throughout her body by hugging herself tightly. It was as if she was being driven by a surge of past memories. Gally had shattered the knife with a swift movement, but now she was left standing in the darkness, shaken by something deep within her.
