Aside from occasionally adjusting the equipment, Ido stared intently at the monitor. Several waveforms displayed on the screen reflected in his round glasses, their light tracing smooth, slow arcs. If the thawing process had gone well, she should be waking up soon.

As Ido let out the breath he'd been holding deep in his lungs, the door to the operating room creaked open with a dull sound.

"Hey, Ido! What's got you so worked up this time, huh?" The voice came from a man over fifty, shaking his large belly as he swaggered into the room with a bottle of liquor in hand. 

This man, named Gonzu, was one of the few friends Ido had. Gonzu, entirely human except for the iron plate riveted to his head like a manhole cover, filled the room with the pungent smell of alcohol as he entered. Ido wrinkled his nose slightly at the scent but continued typing on the keyboard connected to the monitor without turning around.

“Hey, Gonzu, look at this. It’s amazing, this girl.”

“What? It’s just some old kid's junk, isn’t it? You went and picked up more of this kind of stuff again?”
