“Haha... ha, haha! Even something absurd is worth believing in when you have a hunch about it!” Ido shouted to the sky, trembling. The girl’s head felt unexpectedly heavy. Moreover, no matter how much he shook it, the center of gravity within the girl’s head didn’t shift, as if it were like a hard-boiled egg. While he couldn’t understand the exact condition, this meant there was a possibility that the brain inside the girl’s skull had somehow been preserved.

“I’ve never heard of anything like this before. Could a human brain, which has been inactive for hundreds of years, really begin functioning again?” No... wait, back in that city... A memory flashed across Ido’s mind, and it quickly spurred him to make a decision. 

“It’s worth a shot!” he said. “I’ll take her to my clinic and attempt a revival operation.”

With renewed resolve, Ido hurried away from the scrapyard where the stars had just begun to twinkle, rushing back to his home, where the necessary equipment awaited.
