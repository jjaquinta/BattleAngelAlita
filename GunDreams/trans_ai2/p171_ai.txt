The child ran off toward the main street, disappearing from sight.

"What the... What the hell is going on?" Norinco mumbled, his drunken speech slurred, shaking his head in confusion. As he gathered his thoughts, he realized something familiar about the child who had just bumped into him. 

"Wait a minute... that kid... Could it be?" 

"Dammit, you killed my father!" 

The image of the boy he had spared earlier that night flashed vividly in Norinco's mind. The appearance, the presence, the voiceâ€”all matched perfectly with the boy he had encountered just an hour ago. His mind suddenly cleared from the fog of alcohol, and Norinco clenched his teeth, glaring into the dark alley that reeked of burning. 

The faint smell from before had now grown stronger, filled with a sharp, acrid stench that stung his nose. 

"No... It can't be. No way!" 

A terrible premonition welled up inside him, making him feel nauseous. Without hesitation, Norinco started running down the snowy alley, driven by an overwhelming sense of dread.
