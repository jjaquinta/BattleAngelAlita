After the clouds that had hidden the moon drifted away with the wind, what remained in the cold, blue moonlight was the headless body of the man and the knife standing upright like a gravestone in the alley. The woman's name was **Kyarriko**.

Around the perimeter of **The Scrapyard**, there were mounds of discarded waste in a ring-like formation. It was a desolate landscape of mountains of waste, remnants of the previous century, which had piled up over hundreds of years along with red rust, creating a high ridge across the surface. At first glance, it seemed like a dead world, but to this world, where everything had decayed and disappeared, it was a precious treasure trove of resources.

It was the season after October. Bathed in the light of the red setting sun that had melted into the horizon, a girl, half-buried in the desolate heaps of scrap, was now partially exposed on the surface. This was due to the work of the heavy machinery used for waste disposal, which had excavated her from the mounds that had buried her for so long.
