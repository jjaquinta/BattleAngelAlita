Long shadows stretched across the alley, dancing at Ido’s feet as he hid against the wall. The silhouettes appeared to be two women walking together. Ido casually reached into his left pocket. Pulling out a single round chip, he flicked it with a *ping* sound, sending it rolling down the alley. The chip bounced along like a wheel before tipping over in front of the women as they walked, illuminated by the moonlight.

The moment the two women saw the dark outline of the chip gleaming in the alley, their eyes widened. 

“Agh!”  
“Kyaa!”  

One of the women let out a simultaneous cry and dashed towards the chip like a monkey, her arm reaching for it. At that exact moment, Ido, having coiled his entire body with focused energy, sprang out into the moonlight, releasing all his pent-up power and ferocity.

"Oooooahhh!"
