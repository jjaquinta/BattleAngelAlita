As Gally lifted her head, she saw the strange name of the bar, "Gamma Ray," written above the entrance. *"If I go in here, there’s no worry about them escaping, but if a fight breaks out in there..."* Gally knew that if she entered the bar, her presence would immediately stand out, and it would become difficult to continue tailing the two bounty targets. Worse, she might be forced into a brawl inside the bar, with other customers likely around.

As a beginner Hunter-Warrior, it was ideal to lure her targets into an open space where she could fight without worrying about bystanders. But to do that, she’d need to wait outside patiently for the two to leave the bar. However, that wasn’t a good option for Gally, who needed to be home before dawn.

*"Ugh... hmm... ah, whatever!"* After pacing back and forth in front of the bar entrance with her mouth in a frustrated frown, Gally finally shook her head vigorously and grabbed the door handle.

Just as she turned the old knob and pulled to open the door, there was a loud crash, and the door suddenly burst open from the inside with a scream, as if it had exploded.
