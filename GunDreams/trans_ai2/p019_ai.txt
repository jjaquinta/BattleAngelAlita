"Wh-what the hell is going on?"

After a few seconds, the knife attached as an extra to his gripped left hand finally fell, spinning rapidly beside the man, and stuck into the asphalt of the alley.

The shadow did not evade the man's knife, which was being swung down at high speed; instead, it swept a kick across the wrist holding the knife from the side at a speed far exceeding that.

That shadow's kick was truly a work of art. It was a kicking technique with a supple movement like a waterfowl spreading its wings to take flight, yet at the same time, it held the destructive power akin to a raptor's talons tearing apart its prey.

As the blade of the knife descended rapidly, the shadow's folded kicking leg extended almost straight upward like a whip. Then, lifting the heel of the supporting foot off the ground, pivoting sharply inward around the base of the big toe, the body turned to almost face forward. As the kicking leg received the explosive force from the supporting leg that had risen onto tiptoe with the heel's rotation, the lower leg from the folded knee was released, twisting sharply inward. At this moment, the kick's power reached its maximum, impacting the man's left wrist that held the knife, severing it.

The shadow's kick, surpassing textbook perfection, took less than a fraction of a second to complete. Moreover, astonishingly, the shadow unleashed this supremely powerful kick **after** confirming that the man was swinging down his knife.

Not only had the shadow's kicking technique reached a godlike level, but their reflexes had as well. Yet, questions remained. No matter how artistic or divine their skills were, could a mere kick not just break but sharply sever the wrist of a steel-made cyborg?

However, the man's mechanical left wrist had indeed been cleanly severed. It seemed there was something beyond just the shadow's advanced kicking techniques at play.

By the time the man vaguely sensed this crucial detail and shuddered, the shadow was already stepping on his back, rendering him immobile.

"D-damn it!" The man, lying face-down and being stepped on, desperately twisted his neck to glare at his hated pursuer.

What appeared at the edge of his vision as he painstakingly looked up was a tall, slender figure with silver-framed glasses and red—it was a red pineapple-like hairstyle.

"A woman?"

"Heh heh, well, at least my consciousness and chromosomes are," the pursuer stepping on the man said, twisting her red lips.

Indeed, her facial features and bodyline were those of a woman. However, the woman's body, visible beneath her rumpled long coat that only reached above the knees, was entirely an artificial body made of steel and ceramics. She was a full-body cyborg, with everything except the skin on her face and her hair fully mechanized.

The full-body cyborg woman leaned over, resting her elbow on the knee of the foot that was stepping on the man, and gave a sarcastic smile at his pathetic state.

"The hunter who blew off my wrist with a kick is a full-body cybernetic maniac chick?" The man desperately twisted his neck and spat out, trying to act tough.

In response to the man's insolent attitude, the woman didn't smile but pressed down harder with the foot on his back.

Under the woman's steel foot, a sound like stepping on a bundle of dry twigs—
