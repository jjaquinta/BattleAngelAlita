The man likely joined some mystical religion in **The Scrapyard** for some reason, and there, he must have inhaled the scent of cacti. After that, he drowned in the familiar taste of his rural hometown and continued using it so much that hallucinations became a part of his daily life. Then, during one of his bad trips, he started committing murders repeatedly until he eventually became a wanted man. 

Coming from the countryside to **The Scrapyard**, getting lost in the chaos, turning to drugs, and spiraling into madness—this too was a common story in **The Scrapyard**.

“Dad... Mom…”

The woman, leaning against the wall and staring into the void, suddenly recalled the man’s last words, shouted in desperation. His dying plea for his family. 

“What a mess... Man, what a bad aftertaste this job leaves.”

With a sigh, she exhaled a thick cloud of purple smoke from her cigarette and looked up at the sky. Low clouds drifted along with the wind, obscuring the moonlight. The woman spat out the stub of her cigarette and, carrying the man’s severed head in one hand, lazily walked away down the alley.

The gentle night breeze caught her tattered coat, causing its hem to flutter as she disappeared into the shadows.
