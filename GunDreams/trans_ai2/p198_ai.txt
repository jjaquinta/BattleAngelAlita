"This is the place..." Gally muttered as she entered the ruins. The area was vast and open, with parts of the roof collapsed, and steel beams and pillars lay strewn about. The machinery had long since been removed, leaving the space eerily empty. 

At her feet, she noticed the headless cyborg body of Norinco and the discarded clothing of the Breda doll. Gally tensed up, adopting a combat stance as she called out in a loud, clear voice that echoed through the dilapidated space.

"Norinco! Where are you hiding? I'll be your opponentâ€”Gally!"

Her voice was soon met with a wheezing, rasping laugh. "Huhuhu... well now, are you just a little kid, maybe? Ain't it a bit too early for you to be facing me, little one?" The voice was far different from the elderly Norinco she had encountered during the day, dripping with a sinister confidence.

"Don't mock me!" Gally snapped back, her voice brimming with resolve. "I am a Hunter-Warrior!"

With that, she let out a sharp cry and kicked a nearby partially broken pillar. With just one blow, the pillar, a meter in diameter and reinforced with steel, shattered into pieces.
