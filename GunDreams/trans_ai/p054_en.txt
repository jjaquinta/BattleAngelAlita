The "Ido that Gally had never once seen before" left the town and walked away.
"Where is he going...?"
There was a bit of fear in Gally's heart about the unknown night town, but it wasn’t enough to stop her heightened curiosity.
With every heartbeat, the flame of curiosity spread throughout her mind, quickly raising an uncontrollable fire.
Gally rushed out of her room with great force, exiting the clinic. She dashed off into the night of The Scrapyard.
The Scrapyard’s eastern entertainment district.
At night, the area is as vibrant as heaven and as toxic as hell, illuminated by garishly colored neon lights.
