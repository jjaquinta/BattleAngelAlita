The woman, moving swiftly and silently, leaped over the counter like a big cat, closing in on Gally's back with a smooth, predatory speed. In her hands, she gripped two long needles, each about 30 centimeters, weapons that had claimed countless lives. Her most effective tactic was to feign weakness, exploiting people's sympathy, only to strike them down in a moment of vulnerability. The number of people she had killed this way far exceeded that of her companions. "Foolish little girl," she thought, ready to make Gally regret her moment of mercy in hell. Just as the woman moved to plunge a needle into Gally's ear, it happened.

"Hey, you know something? You donâ€™t throw a finishing blow, you drop it." A deep voice boomed close to her ear. The moment she heard it, the woman felt an overwhelming force on her body, and suddenly, she was weightless. Lifted from the floor, her world flipped upside down before she could even comprehend what was happening. A split second later, her head was violently slammed into the ground, and she lost consciousness forever. 

After the heavy thud, the bar returned to its eerie silence, with only the melancholic, sepia-toned tune of an old record playing like a lonely ghost. By the time Gally sensed the killing intent behind her and turned around, the woman was already lying on the floor, her head slumped backward.
