Norinco wandered into an alley after leaving the bar, slightly unsteady on his feet from drinking. His apartment was relatively close, about a ten-minute walk, which allowed him to loosen up a bit and have more to drink than usual. As snowflakes fell gently onto his heated face, it felt refreshing, and he walked slowly, gazing up at the night sky.

After about five minutes of walking through the back alleys in a dreamy state, Norinco suddenly caught a whiff of something burning. "What's this smell...?" he muttered suspiciously, wrinkling his brow and sniffing the air. Something was definitely burning nearby.

"Outta the way!" 

Just as Norinco was trying to figure out what might be burning, a child suddenly burst from the corner of the alley, running frantically. The child collided with Norinco and fell hard but got back up without so much as a glance in his direction before taking off at full speed again.
