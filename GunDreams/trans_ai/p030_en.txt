The spinal disk had decayed, become damaged, or fallen apart, and more than half of the artificial spine had torn away, making it impossible to gauge its functionality. At this point, this cyborg girl's body no longer held anything that could satisfy Idoâ€™s intellectual curiosity. This cyborg was nothing more than an old piece of junk.

"If only I had found her a hundred years earlier."

Ido let out a small sigh, scratching his head. He stood up, turning his back on the girl's remains to bid farewell. Had the damage been a bit lighter, he could have taken her body home and added it to his underground antique collection.

With a sense of lingering attachment, Ido began to descend the slope. After taking a few steps down, he glanced back. The girl's remains were still lying atop the pile of scrap, unchanged. Bathed in the orange light of the setting sun, he thought, What a truly strange girl. Amidst countless cyborg remains, she alone seemed strangely alive.
