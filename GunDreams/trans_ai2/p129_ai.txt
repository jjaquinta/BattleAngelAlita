Panting heavily, Norinco hissed out a breath. The old man, now fully on the defensive like a silkworm in a cocoon, relentlessly struck at Calico with a rapid barrage of sharp finger thrusts. Overjoyed with his advantage, Norincoâ€™s attacks grew increasingly reckless. 

In that moment, for just a split second, the force of his attacks caused his body to shift slightly off balance, tilting his axis away from Calico at a diagonal.

Sensing this in an instant, Calico reacted with the precision of a spider lunging at its prey. She charged forward, slamming her shoulder into Norinco before he could recover his footing. The quick-moving old man, unable to correct his stance in time, stumbled. 

"Sh-shit...!" Norinco gasped, his body thrown off balance.

"Rrrraaaaahhh!" Calico roared as she lunged forward, taking advantage of the opening to close the distance between them.
