Chapter 1

"Shiiiiingâ€”"

The man ran, fleeing through the night illuminated by the moonlight. It was a dark road with no streetlights. A cable that had snapped from a wall dangled, and sparks from the frayed wires flared in white light, illuminating the darkness like an animation. The light flickered, and the man's crazed figure dashed through the shifting light and shadow.

The man was a half-cyborg, with part of his head and his left arm mechanized. He was gripping an old, worn machete, which gleamed faintly. Blackened blood clung thickly to the blade. This was a desolate, filthy part of town, far from the entertainment district of The Scrapyard, and he was circling through the narrow gaps between the abandoned buildings, like a rat through pipes.
