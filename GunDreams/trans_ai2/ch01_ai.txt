CHAPTER 1

“Kihee!” The man was running frantically through the moonlit night. There were no streetlights in the dimly lit alleys. Sparks from torn and hanging cables on the crumbling walls illuminated the darkness with a pale blue light. The man’s wild figure dashed through the flickering light and shadow, appearing and disappearing like an animation. He was a half-cyborg with part of his head and his left arm mechanized. In his machine arm, he gripped a large, old machete, its faintly gleaming blade stained with thick, dark blood.

This place was a district far removed from the pleasure quarters of **The Scrapyard**, where only grimy alleys, like capillaries, wound through the narrow gaps between buildings, devoid of life.

The man ran aimlessly through the narrowing and widening alleys. Whenever a side street split off, he would whip his head around like a starving wild dog, hesitate for a moment, and then dart down one of the alleys, as if on impulse.

"I'll be killed... I'll be melted..." the man muttered, trembling in fear of hallucinations. His clouded eyes saw the alleys twist and writhe like obscene, red-black tongues, as if they were alive, pulsating and ready to swallow him whole.

Though crying out in terror at these illusions, he did not stop running. He plunged deeper into the dark maze of alleys, knowing there was no turning back. He was convinced that if he stopped, the walls around him would immediately spew acid and dissolve him completely, leaving no trace. At this point, if you were to squeeze the man's brain, alkaloids would ooze out like juice—he was suffering from withdrawal symptoms and a bad trip caused by plant-based drugs.

Oh no, the sound of footsteps is getting closer. They're coming to melt me...

The man’s desperate escape through countless alleys finally ended at a dead end. He was stopped by a deep, filthy sewer river, and the alley abruptly came to a halt there. Leaning his back against a wire mesh fence built along the bank of the sewer, he trembled as he looked down the alley. The far end of the alley he had just run through was swallowed by darkness, as if cut off by another dimension, making it invisible.

The towering walls on all sides seemed to press down on him, as if ready to crush him. "No! Stop! Stop it!" he screamed with a face contorted in desperation. He switched the old knife he was holding to his right hand and slashed at his own arm. Once, twice—the skin split open, revealing pink flesh, which was quickly covered by the blood that spurted out.

"Agh! No! Ahh!" The intense pain in his arm made his breathing erratic, his chest rising and falling like a bellows. But as the pain overwhelmed his consciousness, the man’s blurred vision rapidly began to regain clarity. As his hallucinations faded and his awareness returned, he let out a twisted, guttural laugh. And then, he stared into the emptiness ahead.

He muttered "Serves you right, serves you right," over and over again. The hallucinations had vanished. However, there was a reality that had been chasing the man, mingling with his hallucinations. This reality did not disappear along with the hallucinations even when his consciousness cleared. The reality was the existence of his pursuer—the reason he was fleeing while suffering from hallucinations.

"Ah, so you cornered the cheaper bounty head, did you? Hey, do you recognize me, Mr. 90,050 chips?"

The man's vision, which had been blurred and distorted into single and triple outlines until moments ago, had already recovered. At the words directed at him, he strained his bloodshot eyes into the darkness of the alley and saw a shadow seeping out from it.

"You're not a hallucination, are you, you damn Hunter?"

The shadow, as if cut out in human form from the darkness, slowly stepped out from the depths of the alley with hard footsteps striking the pavement. Then, dropping a rolled-up bounty list at his feet, he crushed it with a crunch.

"Don't think you can hunt me so easily."

The man wiped his blood-soaked right arm, lowered his stance, and readied his knife. Perhaps because he had survived countless battlefields, his posture was well-practiced and left little room for openings.

At the man's stance, the shadow let out a sigh and whispered in a low voice.

"A serial killer who only targets women would fetch a slightly better bounty, but well, a hunter will do for today."

"Haah!"

With a shout, the man sharply kicked off the ground. From a leap that seemed impossible for a mere human—like that of a mountain monkey—he swung his knife straight down onto the shadow's head. His mechanical left arm unleashed immense power, and the accelerated tip of the knife sliced through the air, emitting a sound like a whistle.

It was the one-hit kill technique that had sent many victims and pursuers to their graves.

Just as the man's deadly blade was about to touch the shadow's head, a sharp glint flashed in the shadow's eyes, reflecting the dull light of the knife's blade.

In an instant, a red light raced upward from beneath the shadow. Its brilliance traced an arc from the ground to the sky like a crimson banner before melting into the darkness. Almost simultaneously with the crimson banner of light streaking through the darkness, a high-pitched, clear "ping" echoed, shaking the walls of the dark alley.

"W-what...?" The man felt a sense of unease at the absence of the thrill that should have surged when he plunged his blade into the enemy's skull. The resistance of the knife, which should have been felt with the centrifugal force, had vanished somewhere just before touching the shadow's head, leaving him swinging his left arm downward to the ground as if striking nothing but air.

Pulled by the momentum of his swing, the man somersaulted in midair and landed on his back on the pavement, rolling over.

"Ahhh! M-my hand!"

It was when he landed on his back and, due to the pain, reached behind with his left arm that he finally noticed the sense of loss and let out a scream. His left mechanical arm had been severed at the wrist during that brief encounter with the shadow. The wrist of his mechanical arm displayed a sharp cut surface, emitting heat and faint wisps of smoke.

The shadow stood before his eyes as if nothing had happened.

"Wh-what the heck is going on?"

After a few seconds, the knife attached as an extra to his gripped left hand finally fell spinning rapidly beside the man and stuck into the alley's asphalt.

The shadow did not avoid the man's knife, which was being swung down at high speed; instead, it swept a kick across the wrist holding the knife from the side at a speed far exceeding that.

That shadow's kick was truly a work of art. It was a kicking technique with a supple movement like a waterfowl spreading its wings to take flight to the sky, yet at the same time, it held the destructive power akin to a raptor's talons tearing apart its prey.

As the blade of the knife descended rapidly, the shadow's folded kicking leg extended almost straight upward like a whip. Then, lifting the heel of the supporting foot off the ground, pivoting sharply inward around the base of the big toe, the body turned to almost face forward.

As the kicking leg received the explosive force from the supporting leg that had risen onto tiptoe with the heel's rotation, the lower leg from the folded knee was released, twisting sharply inward. At this moment, the kick's power reached its maximum, impacting the man's left wrist that held the knife, severing it.

The shadow's kick, which surpassed textbook perfection, took less than a fraction of a second to complete. Moreover, astonishingly, the shadow unleashed this supremely powerful kick **after** confirming that the man was swinging down his knife.

Not only had the shadow's kicking technique reached a godlike level, but his reflexes had as well. Yet, questions remained. No matter how artistic or divine his skills were, could a mere kick not just break but sharply sever the wrist of a steel-made cyborg?

However, the man's mechanical left wrist had indeed been cleanly severed. It seemed there was something beyond just the shadow's advanced kicking techniques at play.

By the time the man vaguely sensed this crucial detail and shuddered, the shadow was already stepping on his back, rendering him immobile.

"D-Damn it!" the man cursed, lying face-down as he struggled to twist his neck and glare at his hated pursuer.

What appeared at the edge of his vision as he painstakingly looked up was a tall, slender figure with silver-framed glasses and red—

What appeared at the edge of his vision as he painstakingly looked up was a tall, slender figure with silver-framed glasses and red—it was a red pineapple-like hairstyle.

"A woman?"

"Heh heh, well, at least my consciousness and chromosomes are," the pursuer stepping on the man said, twisting her red lips.

Indeed, her facial features and bodyline were those of a woman. However, the woman's body, visible beneath her rumpled long coat that only reached above the knees, was entirely an artificial body made of steel and ceramics. She was a full-body cyborg, with everything except the skin on her face and her hair fully mechanized.

The full-body cyborg woman leaned over, resting her elbow on the knee of the foot that was stepping on the man, and gave a sarcastic smile at his pathetic state.

"The hunter who blew off my wrist with a kick is a full-body cybernetic maniac chick?" The man desperately twisted his neck and spat out, trying to act tough.

In response to the man's insolent attitude, the woman didn't smile but pressed down harder with the foot on his back.

Under the woman's steel foot, a sound like stepping on a bundle of dry twigs—

A loud cracking sound echoed, and the man flailed his limbs like an insect, screaming.

"Yes... yes! I love that sound of bones."

Enjoying the sensation of crushed bones, the woman repeatedly stomped on the man's back, licking the corner of her lips—shaped into a cruel smile—with her blood-colored tongue.

As the light in her eyes sparkled behind her glasses, she spoke to the man, whose bravado had completely vanished and who now trembled in mere fear of pain and death.

"Never thought I'd have to use a cartridge on someone like you, worth just 90,050 chips. These things are expensive, you know?"

Lifting the hem of her worn-out coat, the woman pointed to the leg she was using to step on the man.

On the shin of that mechanical leg, which had lost any human form, there was a bolt-like handle reminiscent of those seen on firearms and a semi-cylindrical shutter resembling an ejection port.

With a heavy clanking sound, the woman pulled the bolt, causing the shutter to slide open and eject a cylindrical cartridge from inside.

"It's equipped with a heat-ray blade—an electric heating system built into my shin, like a Bowie knife. That's what it is."


"That's a heated battery cartridge. This, here."

The woman said so, while inserting a cartridge, about 10 centimeters long, into her coat pocket.

"Is that the sound I heard when you did it?"

The secret of the woman's kick was a gimmick where a blade heated up by the battery could slash enemies with its sharpness and impact power. The blade was sufficiently preheated to be deadly, but the cartridge system had a limitation in the number of uses.

The high-speed kick unleashed from her foot released an electric heated blade that cut down the enemy with surgical precision. It was especially effective when it came to close combat, where the kick's reach would increase its threat significantly.

"Well, if I don't finish this soon, it'll interfere with tomorrow's work."

She said it casually, her plump red lips curving into a smile. The man, hearing her laughter, shuddered and trembled.

"Pl-Please... help me!"


"Don't think you can hunt me so easily," the man said as he wiped his blood-soaked right arm, lowered his stance, and readied his knife. Perhaps because he had survived countless battlefields, his posture was well-practiced and showed no significant openings.

At the man's stance, the shadow let out a sigh and whispered in a low voice.

"A serial killer who only targets women would fetch a slightly better bounty, but well, you'll do for today."

"Haah!" With a shout, the man sharply kicked off the ground. From a leap that seemed impossible for a mere human—like that of a mountain monkey—the man swung his knife straight down onto the shadow's head. His mechanical left arm unleashed immense power, and the accelerated tip of the knife sliced through the air, emitting a sound like a whistle.

It was the one-hit kill technique that had sent many victims and pursuers to their graves.

Just as the man's deadly blade was about to touch the shadow's head, a sharp glint flashed in the shadow's eyes, reflecting the dull light of the knife's blade.

"Eek, stop it!"

The man had already lost all composure.

"Is that all you have to say? Come on, since it's your last moment, say something more clever and die with a clear mind, okay?"

Sensing his impending fate, the man flailed desperately, but there was nothing he could do against the strength and weight of the woman stepping on his back. Even though she was designed in a female form, a full-body cyborg possesses considerable power.

As the heat from the blade protruding from the woman's leg scorched his cheek, the man screamed again.

"Ahhh, Dad, Mom...!"

As if to silence the man's dying words, the woman casually swung the blade of her foot. With a slicing sound and the smell of burning flesh wafting, the man's head separated from his body without ceremony.

As if protesting the sudden separation from its head, the man's body twitched and convulsed two or three times at the woman's feet. Letting out a small sigh, the woman leaned against the wall and searched her coat pocket.

The woman pulled her hand from her pocket—

Sweat and tears streamed down the man's face as if his skin were melting, and he pleaded with the woman. However, she slowly shook her head in response. A few strands of her thin, reddish hair touched her white forehead and swayed—a sign of refusal.

"If I don't cash in a hunter's head at the Factory, I can't recharge my cartridges. Without the heat, my red-hot legs would just be pop-out knives, wouldn't they?"

While still stepping on the man, the woman turned sideways and slowly stepped her right foot beside the trembling man's neck. The eyes of the man lying face-down widened as if they might pop out, fixated on the cold, dull-colored steel leg of the woman.

"Since it's a special occasion, I'll let you see my red-hot leg up close, okay? Look, it's still hot from the residual heat."

With the sound of modules activating, the steel toes of the woman's foot split open, and from the calf area, a dangerous blade with the sharpness of a spear and the thickness of a knife slowly emerged from the ankle. The blade was slightly charred and blackened, with a thin layer of soot-like substance clinging to the edge. Its center glowed faintly red, radiating heat.

"Was that it?"

The woman blew a puff of cigarette smoke onto the man’s neck. "You got yourself hooked on that old-fashioned junk, mescaline, tripping out and killing workers in your flashy, drug-fueled stupor. That’s why you ended up being hunted by me, right?"

Mescaline is an alkaloid derived from cacti with hallucinogenic properties. Unlike synthetic drugs such as LSD, which are produced in labs, cocaine and mescaline can be easily and cheaply extracted in large quantities from cultivated plants, provided they’re of decent quality. 

Indeed, due to its simplicity, mescaline is a popular drug in the desert surrounding **The Scrapyard**, where cacti containing it grow abundantly. However, inside **The Scrapyard**, where much stronger and more addictive synthetic drugs are in fashion, mescaline’s only real use is in cheap mystic cults, where it’s given to believers.

Its effects are simple, short-lived, and require large amounts to be inhaled, making it a primitive and labor-intensive drug. In **The Scrapyard**, the only people still hooked on this stuff were either from remote villages or factory workers from rural backgrounds, far from the heart of the city.

The man likely joined some mystical religion in **The Scrapyard** for some reason, and there, he must have inhaled the scent of cacti. After that, he drowned in the familiar taste of his rural hometown and continued using it so much that hallucinations became a part of his daily life. Then, during one of his bad trips, he started committing murders repeatedly until he eventually became a wanted man. 

Coming from the countryside to **The Scrapyard**, getting lost in the chaos, turning to drugs, and spiraling into madness—this too was a common story in **The Scrapyard**.

“Dad... Mom…”

The woman, leaning against the wall and staring into the void, suddenly recalled the man’s last words, shouted in desperation. His dying plea for his family. 

“What a mess... Man, what a bad aftertaste this job leaves.”

With a sigh, she exhaled a thick cloud of purple smoke from her cigarette and looked up at the sky. Low clouds drifted along with the wind, obscuring the moonlight. The woman spat out the stub of her cigarette and, carrying the man’s severed head in one hand, lazily walked away down the alley.

The gentle night breeze caught her tattered coat, causing its hem to flutter as she disappeared into the shadows.

After the clouds that had hidden the moon drifted away with the wind, what remained in the cold, blue moonlight was the headless body of the man and the knife standing upright like a gravestone in the alley. The woman's name was **Kyarriko**.
