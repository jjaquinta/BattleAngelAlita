Ido pointed to the monitor he had been looking at and showed it to Gonzo. Gonzo let out a burp and brought his reddened face closer to the girl who was secured on the operating table. To Gonzo, and likely anyone else, she would indeed seem like just a piece of junk. Half-destroyed, with her functions shut down, and her closed eyes still covered by the sunken eyelids, Gonzo squinted at the monitor.

"Hey, what the hellâ€¦ This old piece of junk is still functioning?"

Ido smiled with satisfaction and said, "Calling her junk is a bit harsh. She's a fine human being," pointing at the monitor with his finger.

Gonzo rubbed his chin with a thick finger, squinting as he continued looking at the monitor.

"I checked, and this girl's brain has been inactive for around two hundred years, buried in the scrap heap. But thanks to some kind of procedure, her brain tissue was preserved. I found that out and managed to revive her brain."

"You're one weird guy, huh?"
