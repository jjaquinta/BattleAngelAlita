Na...me?

The girl only cast a blank gaze at Ido, making no attempt to respond. She had completely lost her memory during the long period of inactivity. After thinking for a moment, Ido nodded at the girl, whose expression was still hazy as if she had just woken up.

"From today, your name will be Gally."

The girl smiled, as if mimicking Idoâ€™s smile. Having lost everything, she was simply happy to have been given a name by Ido. The name came from a male cat Ido had owned, which had died the previous year.

Five days had passed since the girl had woken up and been given the name Gally.
