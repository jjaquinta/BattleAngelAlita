"Hoo, baby!" Colt growled. "So, are you a bounty target?" Gally took a step forward and cautiously asked, locking her gaze on Colt. He chuckled at her stance, answering with a sneer. 

"Oh, baby, are you a Hunter? That’s a surprise. I’m no fool, though—I haven't been reckless enough to end up on any wanted list. But if you’re in the mood for a fight..."

Colt suddenly grabbed one of his henchmen nearby. 

"Huh? What’s up, Colt?" The man barely finished his sentence before Colt casually snapped his neck, as if cracking an egg. The man's body convulsed, his pants staining with waste, before he went limp.

"Ahh, so that’s my future happy ending?" one of the thugs muttered, trembling.

"Haha... killing might be kinda fun, though," another grinned, his expression twisted. Each henchman reacted in their own bizarre way, but Colt continued, undeterred.
