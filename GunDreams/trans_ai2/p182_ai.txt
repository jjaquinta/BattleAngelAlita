"...Calico and Sig were killed by a murderer?" Gally was shocked by the words she had just heard.  
"Yeah, it happened the day Sig brought you to see Calico," came the response. The next morning after the rain, they found Sig dead, her body minced into tiny pieces. As for Calico, she fought the killer by the riverbank along the sewer, but she too was torn apart and killed. 

Gally left the Pink Cabaret and walked aimlessly down the street, deeply troubled. She couldn’t believe that Calico had been defeated. It was unimaginable to her that someone as skilled as Calico could lose in a one-on-one fight. To make matters worse, no trace of the culprit was found at the scene, indicating that the assailant had likely walked away without a scratch.

"I’ll never be able to fight Calico again..." Gally murmured as she walked with her head down. Just then, her ears picked up the sound of a man's threatening voice, a woman's shriek, and the faint pleading and cries of an old man, all coming from the edge of the crowded street.
