The place where Shig took Gally was behind one of The Scrapyard's top pink cabarets, located near the heart of the eastern district's entertainment hub.

“Does Kyariko live in a place like this?” Gally asked, to which Shig chuckled softly and explained.

“They call her 'Kyariko the Vagabond.' That woman doesn’t have a proper home. She works as a bouncer for all kinds of places in the entertainment district, so you could say the entire district is basically her home.”

As they walked down the grimy alley, they reached the back entrance of the cabaret. Gally and Shig entered through the door and made their way down the hallway, arriving at one of the dressing rooms for the strippers.

“Hey, it’s me, Shig!” Shig called out, banging on the door roughly. After a brief pause, there was the sound of the doorknob turning.

“Quit making such a racket. Did you finally catch a lead on the serial killer?”
