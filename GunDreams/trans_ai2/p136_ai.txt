CHAPTER 7

There, a mix of humans and cyborgs came and went, set up stalls, peddled goods, ate and drank, scavenged for items, got drunk and passed out, sat down, and even died. Amidst the dazzling neon lights flickering in the night along the main street of the eastern district of The Scrapyard, Gally swam through the crowd with glee. Lately, Ido had been busy with daytime clinic appointments, and Gally would sneak out into the nighttime city without him noticing. On nights when she planned her escapades, she couldn't help but smile with excitement and thrill, making every effort not to be caught by Ido until he disappeared into his bedroom.

It had been three weeks since she first ventured out alone into the night, during the incident where she had her first trial as a Hunter-Warrior, facing off against Colt. The outcome of that fight was something she had learned after waking up on the maintenance bed a day later, when Ido told her what had happened.
