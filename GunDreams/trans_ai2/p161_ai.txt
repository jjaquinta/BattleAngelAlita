A cloudless night. Deep within the vast scrapyard on the outskirts of The Scrapyard, there lay a desolate ruin. Once functioning as a waste processing plant, it now served only as the resting place of a homeless old man. Orange flames flickered through a hole in the crumbling wall of the dilapidated structure. The old man, Norinco, who had been seen earlier in the day, sat by the fire, hunched over, clutching his head in despair. 

"Breda, in my foolishness...," he groaned, writhing in agony. His hunched silhouette wavered against the wall, illuminated by the flickering flames. "Please, forgive me," he pleaded. Though his eyes had long since gone blind, the last sight they captured remained vividly etched in his mindâ€”an image so clear that, to this day, not a single day had passed without the torment of guilt and regret it evoked.
