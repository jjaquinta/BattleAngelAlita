Just as the woman's head was about to slam into the floor, the mysterious figure who had thrown her held a graceful bridge position, frozen in place. As the woman's body convulsed in its final moments, the figure smoothly transitioned out of the bridge and stood before Gally. It was a full-body cyborg, with a bulky, square-shaped form. Despite resembling a humanoid, the design gave off a non-human, robotic vibe. Most notably, the figure had strange, distinctive hooks mounted on the back of its hands, seemingly designed to lock onto opponents during throws.

"I watched your moves, kid. Not bad at all. But you need to tighten upâ€”you'll get yourself killed being too soft. If you're a Hunter, you should upgrade to a combat body, even if it's a cheap one." The man, who had suddenly appeared and saved Gally, grinned as he offered his critique. Gally responded with a slightly confused expression.

"Hmm. But, mister, where were you hiding while those guys were causing all that trouble?"

The man laughed heartily. "Hahaha, blame it on this secondhand body. My digestive system hasn't been working right lately, so I was off taking care of some business!"
