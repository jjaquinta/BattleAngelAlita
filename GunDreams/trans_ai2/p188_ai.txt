"Breda... Belchea protected you from the inferno when she died," Norinco said. Gally asked, "So, did Belchea give birth to the child before she burned to death?"

"Fushushuu... If she had given birth in that fire, you would have burned to death too. It’s because she didn’t give birth that you were saved. If you had been partially born, even with one hand out of her womb and burned, I would have become an even more unforgivable lump of flesh than I am now," Norinco explained.

Gally furrowed her brows, deep in thought. She had never heard of a dead woman giving birth to a living child. "Is it really possible for a living baby to be born from a woman who has died in a fire?"

Norinco chuckled, his body shaking as he nodded repeatedly. "Fushuu... Under normal circumstances, no. But you were born. In the face of that fact, whether Belchea was alive or dead is such a small detail, isn’t it?"

Gally sighed, glancing at the mannequin-headed doll. Norinco continued to treat Breda as if she had been born from Belchea in those tragic circumstances.
