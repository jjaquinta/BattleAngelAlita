"Oh, scary, scary. A kid like you is worth dismantling," Norinco taunted as he suddenly pounced from above Gally's head. The old man had been observing her from the steel beams of the ruins' roof. 

"Ugh!" Gally narrowly dodged his attack, quickly taking some distance before readying her stance again.

"Did you kill the prostitutes and Shig all for that daughter of yours, Breda, who doesn't even exist?" Gally shouted, her words making Norinco's white hair tremble with anger. The sheer weight of his rising fury made her hesitate for a split second.

"You... I see, you're that same girl who cornered me into despair earlier, aren't you? Gally, was it?" Norinco's body, now inside Breda's, ground his teeth as he glared at Gally with his radar eyes. With a shriek, he closed the distance in an instant, overwhelming Gally.

"Yes, you're right. Breda was never born. Breda was supposed to be the child my wife, Beruchee, was going to give birth to," Norinco howled in response.
