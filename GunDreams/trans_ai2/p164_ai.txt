Norinco, still holding severed heads in both hands, slowly walked toward the trembling boy and spoke in a calm tone. "What's wrong? If you don't hurry, I'll hunt you down too."

"D-Damn it... You killed my dad!" The boy, with tears of fear and anger streaming down his face, picked up the too-heavy knife and wobbled as he tried to swing it. But Norinco easily kicked it away and spoke softly, "I'm in a good mood today. I'm not so bored that I'd hunt down a child who isn't even a bounty."

Then, in a harsher, commanding voice, he continued, "Kid, if you don't want to die, get lost!"

The boy shuddered as if shocked by electricity, then ran off as fast as he could. 

*Did my parents disappear in front of me like that, too?* Norinco wondered. *Will that boy, like me, carry an insatiable hunger for his lost family for the rest of his life?*

Sighing, Norinco shook his head at the thought of feeling pity for the boy. Normally, he would have killed the child without hesitation. But now, he couldn't help feeling sentimental when it came to children.
