"Hisss... Did you catch on yet? These dishes in place of my eyeballs are radar eyes. They visualize ultrasonic waves, allowing me to move easily even in the dark. Though, to be honest, I rely more on intuition and sensing than these gadgets," Norinco said, turning his head as if scanning the surroundings with his radar eyes. He nodded in satisfaction. 

"Hisss... Oh dear, the heavy rain's distorting the sound images a bit, but it looks like we've ended up in a nice spot." 

At some point, Norinco and Calico had emerged from the narrow alley into an open area. 

"This place..." Calico recognized it immediately. In front of them was a wide cul-de-sac, with a chain-link fence at its far end, and beyond that, a deep sewage river flowed. 

This was the same place where she had recently hunted down a junkie, who had turned one of his arms into a cybernetic weapon. His corpse still lay there, rotting on the ground, beaten by the rain, as no one had bothered to clean it up.

Norinco, now in the dead-end alley, had shifted his stance completely. Unlike his earlier defensive posture, he took up a strange and focused pose. He spread his legs wide, lowered his body, and turned almost completely sideways. Then, preparing for something unseen, he waited.
