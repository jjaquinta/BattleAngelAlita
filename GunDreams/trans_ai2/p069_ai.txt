The woman lowered her guard and said, "Oh, my, such a fierce little lady you've turned out to be. Even if I wasn’t serious, dodging that kick is no small feat, huh?" She scratched at her pineapple-shaped red hair with her fingers, twisting her plump red lips into a smirk. Her tall figure, wrapped in a sleek leather coat, was just like Gally’s—made entirely of steel and ceramic, a machine body.

"Who the hell are you?" Gally asked cautiously, trying to assert dominance over the red-haired woman. Inside, however, she was still reeling from the kick and the brief flash of killing intent the woman had unleashed, her whole body trembling with fear. She clenched her teeth, desperately trying to hide her inner turmoil, not wanting to reveal her anxiety to this intimidating redhead.

*Fragments of memories of battles are just starting to wake up deep within me... But I still have no idea how strong those memories truly are.* Gally doubted whether the uncertain fighting skills she was only beginning to recall would be of any use against this dangerous woman before her.

The redhead grinned and responded, "Me? I was hired by a certain someone. My job is to track down and kill that serial killer who's been targeting prostitutes."
