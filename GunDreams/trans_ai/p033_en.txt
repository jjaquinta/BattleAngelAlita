"Haha, even the most ridiculous hunches are worth believing in!"

Ido shouted to the sky, his voice cracking.

The girl's head was surprisingly heavy. But the contents of the girl's skull suggested that the center of gravity had shifted considerably.

"Is it really beginning to function again...?"

Wait a second... back when I was in that city...

The exact condition wasn’t clear, but it was possible that the brain tissue inside the girl’s skull had somehow been preserved.

"I’ve never seen or heard of such a thing. Could a human brain that’s been inactive for hundreds of years really start functioning again?"

A vivid scene flashed through Ido's mind. And then, that faint feeling began to solidify into conviction.

"It’s worth a shot!"

Carrying the girl, Ido headed toward his clinic, planning to attempt an operation to revive her.

With renewed determination, he left the scrapheap behind, hurrying toward his home where the necessary equipment awaited.
