CHAPTER 10

"You're not going again tonight? Have you already given up being a Hunter?" That afternoon, Ido once again invited Gally to join him in hunting down bounty heads, but, just like the last time, she hesitated and declined to go with him.

"Well, it's not that... it's just... I guess I'm starting to wonder why I always have to go with you, Ido," Gally replied, her full lips pouting slightly as she spoke.

To that, Ido teased her, "That's because your way of fighting isn't exactly top-notch. You keep fighting like you did against Colt every time."

"Look, if you keep this up, you're going to end up in a situation you can't come back from!"
Gally fell silent at those words, biting her lip even harder.
"Well then, what should I do if some sleazy guy attacks me, huh, Ido?"
Ido, unable to contain his frustration at Gally's words, slammed his fist hard against the wall and yelled at her.
"You run away."
Gally, offended by that, glared at Ido and responded in a sharp tone.
"I don't want to do that. That's just cowardly!"
"And that's exactly why I can't let you be a Hunter on your own! Have you ever thought about how I feel when you come back hurt? Until you fix that impulsiveness of yours, there's no way I can let you be a Hunter!"
Gally was stung by Ido's harsh words, but she retorted, matching his intensity.
"Fine, whatever!"
But deep down, Gally knew she wanted Ido to acknowledge that she could be a great Hunter on her own.

"Yeah. I can handle things better than you think, Ido," Gally said firmly before dashing out of the house. Left behind, Ido trembled, his repressed emotions toward her finally erupting. "Damn it, damn it! She's mine! Mine!" Ido, overcome with rage, spent three days tearing apart the room in a fit of anger.

After leaving the house, Gally stopped by Bergman's shop to pick up a combat body that had been customized for her. "The design's a bit old-fashioned, but the horsepower is double that of the Cyprian model. The outer shell is made of special self-locking armor, so no ordinary blade can get through. Renting this bad boy for a week costs 30,000 chips—pretty reasonable, eh? What do you think, missy?" Bergman grinned widely as Gally nervously lay down on the operating table, unsure of what was to come.

"Uh, Bergman... are you sure you can really switch my body properly?"

In response to Gally's words, Bergman frowned and pursed his lips before snorting and confidently replying, "You think I can't handle this? I may be a retired ball player, but swapping bodies is a piece of cake for me. Sure, I just picked it up by watching machine engineers, but I've done all the body swaps in this shop myself."

Although Bergman's words initially made Gally feel a little uneasy, he quickly and skillfully completed the body swap. "Wow... you're even faster than Ido," Gally murmured, genuinely impressed as she looked over her new body, which was unpainted and purely metallic in appearance. 

"How's it feel? Any problems or discomfort?" Bergman asked. Gally threw a couple of kicks to test it out, and sure enough, the response was leagues beyond her previous civilian model. The neural and mechanical systems were on a completely different level. Previously, she'd sometimes felt a sense of heaviness or awkwardness in her movements, but with this new body, there was almost no weight to hold her back.

"Thanks, Bergman. I love it!" Gally said, her excitement evident.

Gally said this as she put on the jacket and pants that came with her new body and left the shop. "Hey, girl, if you break it, you'll have to buy it or pay for the repairs!" Bergman's loud, hearty laughter echoed after her as she stepped out into the street, now looking sharp and well-equipped.

"Maybe it's because I was told not to meet her..." Gally thought to herself as she made her way toward the entertainment district after acquiring the combat body. For some reason, she felt an irresistible urge to see Calico. As always, she blended into the crowd, walking slowly and weaving her way through the gaps between people.

But why doesn’t Ido want me to meet Calico?

When Gally woke up from a two-day coma, the first thing she mentioned was Calico. But Ido reacted sensitively to her casual remark, warning her about it.

"...Calico and Sig were killed by a murderer?" Gally was shocked by the words she had just heard.  
"Yeah, it happened the day Sig brought you to see Calico," came the response. The next morning after the rain, they found Sig dead, her body minced into tiny pieces. As for Calico, she fought the killer by the riverbank along the sewer, but she too was torn apart and killed. 

Gally left the Pink Cabaret and walked aimlessly down the street, deeply troubled. She couldn’t believe that Calico had been defeated. It was unimaginable to her that someone as skilled as Calico could lose in a one-on-one fight. To make matters worse, no trace of the culprit was found at the scene, indicating that the assailant had likely walked away without a scratch.

"I’ll never be able to fight Calico again..." Gally murmured as she walked with her head down. Just then, her ears picked up the sound of a man's threatening voice, a woman's shriek, and the faint pleading and cries of an old man, all coming from the edge of the crowded street.

"Please... please forgive me," pleaded the old man.  
"Shut up, you filthy old geezer! This ain’t a place for stinking scum like you, got it?" snarled one of the thugs.  
"Yeah, finish him off, finish him!" squealed one of the women egging them on.  
"He's so annoying! Just kill the old man already!"  

Gally, a bit intrigued by the commotion, glanced over. She saw a gang of lowlifes and a few obnoxious women surrounding a homeless old man, mercilessly beating him. It seemed the old man had begged for some change, which led the women to call for the thugs' help. Excited by the attention from the women, the thug, his face flushed with excitement, kept kicking the old man, who repeatedly begged for mercy while laughing cruelly.

"Hey, that's enough. Cut it out," Gally said as she casually stepped into the middle of the beating. She helped the battered old man up. As she got a closer look, she realized it was someone she had met before—the blind old man, Norinco, who had tried to sell scraps to Bergman's shop only to be chased away.

"You're Norinco, right? Are you okay?" Gally asked, concerned, as Norinco's face trembled slightly with recognition. Although Gally found this reaction a bit odd, she checked to ensure that Norinco wasn’t seriously hurt.

"Hey, who the hell are you?! You think just 'cause you’re a bit cute that I’ll let you get away with this?!" The thug, frustrated by Gally interrupting the beating, sneered at her, pulling out a knife from his pocket. Without a word, Gally grabbed the thug's knife and effortlessly bent the blade with a sharp twist. The man let out a terrified yelp before running off, and the women who had been cheering him on scattered like frightened insects into the crowd.

"Serves them right," Gally snorted, ready to leave when she suddenly felt the old man cling to her from behind.

"Oh, Breda! Even during the day, you're here to help me. What a kind child you are!" Norinco muttered.

"Wait, hold on! Norinco, I'm not Breda. I’m Gally!" she said, startled.

Gally shook off Norinco's grip, trying to explain, but the old man, with tears streaming from beneath the cloth covering his eyes, continued to call her "Breda, Breda."

"This is troublesome... Come on, enough already," Gally muttered, though normally she would have reacted more aggressively in a situation like this. However, a thought crossed her mind that made her hesitate. Norinco had once been a renowned Hunter. Perhaps, by pretending to be Breda, she could learn about the old man's legendary past as a Hunter. Her curiosity flickered, and Gally decided to tolerate the discomfort of being mistaken for someone else.

"Alright, I understand. Could you tell me your story, Norinco? Today, you can share it with... Breda," Gally said, sitting beside the Breda doll placed on the cart's seat.

"Sigh... I am a worthless person," Norinco said, addressing Gally as Breda. "I have no reason to keep living."

"Then why are you still alive?" Gally asked Norinco, who was pulling the cart. He gave a crooked smile.

"Fushushuu... Of course, Breda. I live only to raise you," he replied. Norinco had neither the strength nor the meaning to live for himself anymore. He considered himself nothing more than a lump of flesh. Even so, the only reason he continued to live was for Breda's sake alone.

"I exist only as a body for Breda. It's strange that I even have a consciousness at all. Fushushuu... After all, I died when I lost my sight," Norinco said, recounting his sorrowful past to Gally. He explained how he had lost his body in an accident and, even then, became a bounty hunter to provide for the expensive fertility treatments necessary to have a child. He eventually arranged for a woman named Belchea to undergo the procedure, and she became pregnant. But near the time of birth, due to his negligence, both the woman and the unborn child were burned alive. Consumed by guilt, Norinco had gouged out his own eyes.

Gally could understand the depth of his pain and regret up until that point, but what followed after became difficult for her to comprehend.

"Breda... Belchea protected you from the inferno when she died," Norinco said. Gally asked, "So, did Belchea give birth to the child before she burned to death?"

"Fushushuu... If she had given birth in that fire, you would have burned to death too. It’s because she didn’t give birth that you were saved. If you had been partially born, even with one hand out of her womb and burned, I would have become an even more unforgivable lump of flesh than I am now," Norinco explained.

Gally furrowed her brows, deep in thought. She had never heard of a dead woman giving birth to a living child. "Is it really possible for a living baby to be born from a woman who has died in a fire?"

Norinco chuckled, his body shaking as he nodded repeatedly. "Fushuu... Under normal circumstances, no. But you were born. In the face of that fact, whether Belchea was alive or dead is such a small detail, isn’t it?"

Gally sighed, glancing at the mannequin-headed doll. Norinco continued to treat Breda as if she had been born from Belchea in those tragic circumstances.

Gally wondered aloud, "Did Breda really ever get born?" 

Norinco gave her a strange look, then responded in a mocking tone, "What are you saying, Breda? Look, you're sitting right here, aren't you? It's strange, isn't it, doubting your own birth?"

Gally felt a headache coming on. Breda wasn’t born, she wasn’t alive, and yet Norinco insisted that his daughter Breda had been born. Gally found it increasingly hard to tolerate his insistence. "But, if your mother dies before giving birth, the baby usually dies too, right? So why would I be the exception? That doesn’t make sense."

When Gally said that, Norinco's face turned pale, and he stared at her with his blind, unseeing eyes. The cloth wrapped around his eyes was damp, stained with tears soaking through.

"Fushuuu... Breda, oh, how could this be? You’re trying to deny your own miraculous birth. You seem like a completely different person from your usual gentle and wise self. I swear, I saw it with my own eyes that snowy night. When dead Perché was bathed in light, you descended from the heavens, smiling down on me," Norinco said.

Gally, frustrated, responded in a firm tone, "But your eyes couldn't see by then, right? That was just a hallucination. Breda died in Perché's womb."

Gally was determined to make Norinco understand that the idea of Breda's birth was merely an illusion. She hoped that if the old man could grasp the truth, he might free himself from his fractured reality and self-punishing mindset, and perhaps even find a reason to live for himself.

"Even if I couldn’t see, I know what I saw! And if it’s not true, then the proof that you’re alive is also a fantasy... and my only reason for living too... Oh, Breda, you’re my only light, so why are you so stubborn about denying yourself?" Norinco lamented.

At that, Gally grew furious, grabbed the doll, jumped off the rickshaw, and shouted back at him.

"Listen carefully, Norinco. Breda was never born. This is just a doll," Gally said firmly. "You know that deep down, don't you?"

"A doll? Breda, a doll? Fushuuu, what are you saying, Breda?" Norinco asked, confused. Gally handed him the lifeless Breda doll and shook him gently.

"Look, it doesn’t move at all. It doesn’t even have a pulse. This is just a shell, a part of a cyborg—it’s only a doll. And the one talking to you right now is me, Gally. My name is Gally."

Norinco clutched the lifeless form of Breda in his arms, trembling as he tried to reject the painful truth. He began to sweat as he heard the voice of a girl—clearly not Breda—speaking to him from another direction.

"What’s wrong, Breda? Why aren’t you speaking to me today like you usually do? Why are you so limp?" he asked, desperate.

"Breda was born... she was born..." Norinco muttered.

"You’ve been lying to yourself all this time because you couldn’t forgive yourself, but that’s not right," Gally said, her voice filled with frustration.

Norinco let out a long, anguished cry, unable to accept the truth.

Norinco, still clutching the Breda doll, suddenly bolted at an unnaturally fast speed, far beyond the limits of his frail, worn-out cyborg legs. "Ah, Norinco!" Gally cried out, stunned by his unexpected reaction, and froze in place for a moment.

"I want to know the truth. I have to know the truth. Isn’t knowing the truth the path to happiness?" Gally genuinely believed this without doubt. She didn’t understand that for the elderly Norinco, knowing the truth meant despair. Yet, a strange, uncomfortable feeling weighed heavily in her chest.

Gally ran through the alleyways, trying to catch up to Norinco, but he was already out of sight. "Where did he go?" she muttered, searching the streets over and over. She didn’t know what to do if she found him, but all she wanted was to find the wounded old man.

Am I wrong? She didn’t know. Is it better to believe in something that doesn’t exist or to silently overlook someone's delusions?

At least, for herself, it was something she couldn’t accept. That’s why Gally wanted to tell Norinco the truth as well.

"...So, I ended up here, huh." After running through several alleyways, Gally found herself in a desolate wasteland, far from the structures of the city. She had reached the labyrinth of red ruins in the scrapyard. Looking back towards where she came from, she could just make out the silhouette of the floating city of Zalem, tinted red by the setting sun. This was the very edge of the small world known as The Scrapyard.

As Gally walked through the maze of tangled, decaying remnants of the previous century, she thought about the old man, Norinco. Thinking back on it, it seemed that Norinco had subjected himself to abuse rather than merely being forced into it by being homeless. He lived only to love and raise the imaginary daughter, Breda. When that entire illusion was shattered, he fled in despair, screaming.

"Am I... am I wrong?" Gally wondered. The truth isn’t always something that brings happiness. If that’s the case, would her desire to know her true self, the part of her she had lost, only bring her unhappiness?

Norinco held the Breda doll tightly as she ran, exceeding the limits of her thin, worn-out cyborg legs with an abnormal speed.  
"Ah, Norinco-san!"  
Gally stood frozen for a moment, shocked by Norinco's reaction, which was beyond her imagination. She didn’t want to know the truth. Perhaps it was better not to know the truth. Knowing the truth doesn’t necessarily bring happiness, does it? Gally genuinely believed this, but the strange, bitter aftertaste left a knot in her chest, making her feel uneasy.  

"Damn, where did she go?"  
Gally sprinted through the alleyways, chasing after the fleeing Norinco. She had already lost sight of the old woman. Even though Gally didn’t know what she would do once she caught up to Norinco, she just wanted to find the wounded old woman, no matter what.  

Am I wrong? Is it really okay to believe in something that isn't there, or to stay silent and ignore falsehoods?

...Could reclaiming the ancient martial art within herself also lead to a path of despair?

"…Gally, Norinco is hiding ahead, in the shadows of the scrap heap, you know."

It was at that moment. While Gally was walking through the maze of debris, lost in thought, she suddenly heard a voice from somewhere. It was a voice that she recognized.

"…Could it be… Calico? Calico, is that you? Where are you?"

As Gally looked around, searching, the woman appeared after a few moments.

“Gally, don’t sympathize with the enemy.”

“…Calico, your body…”

The figure that emerged from the shadow of the scrap pile was unmistakably Calico. However, her body no longer resembled her previous form at all. While her head was still that of the original Calico, from the neck down, her body had turned into a strange, inhuman cyborg resembling the shape of a spider.

"Heh heh heh… don’t worry about it, Gally. A cybernetic doctor picked me up when I was on the verge of death."

"There's no doubt about it, that one's a serial killer," Calico said, shaking her head slightly while addressing Gally from atop her spider-like body. "Gally, it’s unfortunate, but you’re the only one who can take them down. They’re terrifyingly strong, and unlike me, they have an uncanny ability to counter fighters who rely on complex combination attacks. They can read the combos, close in, and slowly dismantle their opponent’s limbs bit by bit. It’s like watching a mantis systematically tear the wings off its prey, piece by piece."

As Calico scuttled back into the scrapyard's heaps, she left Gally with one final instruction. "Your unconventional attacks that ignore the centerline give you a real chance. Please, avenge me and Sig. Take them down, Gally."

"Calico... I understand," Gally said, pressing her lips together firmly as she dashed through the maze of scrap. Ahead of her, just as Calico had described, loomed the ruins of an old factory, bathed in the fading light.

"This is the place..." Gally muttered as she entered the ruins. The area was vast and open, with parts of the roof collapsed, and steel beams and pillars lay strewn about. The machinery had long since been removed, leaving the space eerily empty. 

At her feet, she noticed the headless cyborg body of Norinco and the discarded clothing of the Breda doll. Gally tensed up, adopting a combat stance as she called out in a loud, clear voice that echoed through the dilapidated space.

"Norinco! Where are you hiding? I'll be your opponent—Gally!"

Her voice was soon met with a wheezing, rasping laugh. "Huhuhu... well now, are you just a little kid, maybe? Ain't it a bit too early for you to be facing me, little one?" The voice was far different from the elderly Norinco she had encountered during the day, dripping with a sinister confidence.

"Don't mock me!" Gally snapped back, her voice brimming with resolve. "I am a Hunter-Warrior!"

With that, she let out a sharp cry and kicked a nearby partially broken pillar. With just one blow, the pillar, a meter in diameter and reinforced with steel, shattered into pieces.

"Oh, scary, scary. A kid like you is worth dismantling," Norinco taunted as he suddenly pounced from above Gally's head. The old man had been observing her from the steel beams of the ruins' roof. 

"Ugh!" Gally narrowly dodged his attack, quickly taking some distance before readying her stance again.

"Did you kill the prostitutes and Shig all for that daughter of yours, Breda, who doesn't even exist?" Gally shouted, her words making Norinco's white hair tremble with anger. The sheer weight of his rising fury made her hesitate for a split second.

"You... I see, you're that same girl who cornered me into despair earlier, aren't you? Gally, was it?" Norinco's body, now inside Breda's, ground his teeth as he glared at Gally with his radar eyes. With a shriek, he closed the distance in an instant, overwhelming Gally.

"Yes, you're right. Breda was never born. Breda was supposed to be the child my wife, Beruchee, was going to give birth to," Norinco howled in response.

Norinco closed in on Gally with a strange, serpentine movement, his sharp hand strikes grazing her and steadily wearing away the outer layer of her combat body. He maintained a close distance, never allowing her an opening, like a coiled spring ready to strike.

"Breda wanted to be born. Even in this world where worthless flesh rots away, she would have wanted to come into existence and accomplish something. That's why I send her friends to the afterlife, so Breda won't feel lonely anymore," Norinco said with a mad intensity.

Gally desperately searched for an opening, all while parrying his relentless attacks. But Norinco’s left arm, which extended and contracted at will, combined with his rapid strikes from the right hand, made it nearly impossible for her to counter.

"Ugh, I can't allow you to take the lives of real people just for a phantom!" Gally gritted her teeth as she quickly spun around, attempting to sweep Norinco's legs. But the old man lightly leapt into the air, avoiding her move with ease. Still, she anticipated his reaction.

Gally used the momentum from her leg sweep to roll backward onto her hands, executing a spinning upward kick with outstretched legs as she inverted her body. Norinco, still airborne, couldn't evade her kick completely and tumbled to the ground. However, the damage wasn't critical, and the old man quickly regained his footing. Gally clicked her tongue in frustration at the failed strike.

"Sly little girl, using such a tricky move there. But that won’t work again on the Mantis Norinco," he sneered as he crouched into his peculiar stance once more and slithered toward her.

Gally tried to anticipate his movements, shifting her stance to counter, but Norinco's approach was like being trapped in a web—no matter how she moved, he closed in. His coiling left arm wrapped around her limbs, constricting her movements. The old man then struck with his right hand, delivering precise blows to her arms and legs.

Each attack wasn't particularly strong by itself, but gradually, he peeled away the outer layers of her cybernetic body, exposing the actuators and mechanical components beneath. A chilling sense of dread began to creep over her as she realized the systematic dismantling of her defenses.

"Hehehe... How does it feel, Gally? Slowly being dismantled from the edges... Cyborgs tend to neglect defending their limbs because they don't feel pain there. My fighting style exploits that by systematically destroying the extremities and rendering them useless," Norinco cackled. 

Gally, desperate to fend him off, racked her brain to find a weakness in the old man's brutal tactics. So far, Norinco had only been vulnerable to reckless, sacrificial attacks. Gally recalled the advice from Calico: "If you focus on feints and deceptive moves, you'll have a chance."

Suddenly, clarity struck her. "That's it... That's how I can win," Gally realized. 

Though her limbs had been nearly stripped bare by Norinco’s relentless hand strikes, a glimmer of determination returned to her dark eyes. "This is it!" she yelled. Dodging Norinco's next strike, Gally sprinted toward one of the pillars supporting the dilapidated structure. With a powerful hand chop, she shattered the column.

The roof and framework of the ruin, already precariously balanced, began to collapse with a deafening rumble, brought down by Gally's decisive blow.

"Shyunufu... ughhh!" 

After the violent collapse, as the dust settled and the scene revealed itself, the entire area had turned into a mountain of rubble, with not a single pillar left standing. 

After a brief pause, something shifted beneath the debris, and Gally slowly stood up, though she had lost her left arm below the elbow, the steel limb having been severed during the fight. "Did I get him...?" Gally muttered, glancing around as she exhaled deeply.

But in the next moment, with a sudden thud, the rubble shifted, and Norinco emerged, seemingly unscathed despite the massive collapse. 

"Shyuuuu... That gutsy resolve of yours is something else for such a young girl. But it looks like luck is on my side," Norinco sneered.

Gally, sweating from her brow, kept her eyes locked on him, tense. But after a moment, her stern expression softened, and a slight smile crossed her face.

"Nufuu... what's that supposed to mean?" Norinco growled.

"It means I've figured out your weakness," Gally said with a bold smile. 

Norinco hesitated for a moment, but quickly grasped the meaning behind her words, his expression hardening.

"Norinco, your fighting style relies heavily on your footwork. It's a style that corners opponents like pieces on a chessboard, assuming every possible move they might make. But to execute that, you need a wide, stable ground to move on, don't you?" Gally stuck her tongue out teasingly as Norinco gritted his teeth. 

"My style, on the other hand, relies on throwing myself into attacks. It makes me less dependent on the conditions of the terrain. And if it comes down to an aerial fight, you stand no chance against me."

"Shut up!" Norinco roared, leaping from the rubble as his left arm stretched out like a whip. 

Gally launched herself into the air to meet his attack head-on. As Norinco's sharp hand blade shot toward her, Gally twisted her body mid-air, using a figure-skater-like motion with her arms and lower body to add momentum. 

Norinco's hand blade sliced through the air, heading straight for Gally...

At the moment Gally's leg brushed against Norinco’s body, a sharp, clear sound rang out into the red sky. In that brief aerial clash, the two passed each other simultaneously and landed. Gally crouched down, while Norinco stood frozen in place. As Gally wobbled in her stance, her damaged left arm detached from the shoulder and fell to the ground with a thud.

"Fuu... shunuu... you... little... brat," Norinco muttered his last words, before collapsing forward. A closer look revealed that his temple was crushed, with brain matter leaking from his ear. In mid-air, Gally had managed to dodge Norinco's hand blade using her advanced aerial control techniques. By hooking her leg onto his body, she spun around him, positioning herself behind him to strike his temple with her elbow.

The name of that move would later become known as **"Angel's Wing Hook"**, a technique that deeply etched itself into Gally's heart.

Gally approached the fallen Norinco, who lay face down, and gently lifted his body.

"Bre... Bredda..." Norinco muttered weakly.

Norinco whispered in a barely audible voice, his trembling hand reaching out to touch Gally’s cheek as she held him. After a brief hesitation, she gently nuzzled her face against his in response. 

“Thank you, Father... I’m glad I was born,” Gally said softly. At her words, Norinco gave a faint spasm before he stopped moving entirely. In silence, Gally stood up, leaving the rubble behind as the setting sun cast long shadows. By the time the blue dusk had fully settled, light rain began to fall as she stood on the street, staring at the soft glow from a familiar window—her home.

The lights on the first floor, where Ido’s clinic was, had long gone out, signaling the end of the day’s consultations. Only the second floor, Ido’s room, remained illuminated. Dragging her battered body, Gally made her way to the streetlamp where she could still see the house. There, she collapsed, sitting beneath the light, knees pulled close to her chest.

“Gally... is that you?” 

Hearing the familiar voice, Gally, who had been resting her face against her knees in the misty rain, lifted her head with a start, her heart stirred.

Ido stood there with a worried expression, almost like a dream. As Gally trembled and her lips quivered at the sight of him, her eyes filled with tears, and she clung to him.  
Without saying a word, Ido picked up the sobbing Gally and carried her into a warm room, her body soaked.
