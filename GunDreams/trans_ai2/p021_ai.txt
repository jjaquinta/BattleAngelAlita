"That's a heated battery cartridge. This, here."

The woman said so, while inserting a cartridge, about 10 centimeters long, into her coat pocket.

"Is that the sound I heard when you did it?"

The secret of the woman's kick was a gimmick where a blade heated up by the battery could slash enemies with its sharpness and impact power. The blade was sufficiently preheated to be deadly, but the cartridge system had a limitation in the number of uses.

The high-speed kick unleashed from her foot released an electric heated blade that cut down the enemy with surgical precision. It was especially effective when it came to close combat, where the kick's reach would increase its threat significantly.

"Well, if I don't finish this soon, it'll interfere with tomorrow's work."

She said it casually, her plump red lips curving into a smile. The man, hearing her laughter, shuddered and trembled.

"Pl-Please... help me!"
