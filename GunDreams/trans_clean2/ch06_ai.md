### Chapter 6

Late that night, the towering lights of the aerial city Zalem above **The Scrapyard** were swallowed by a thick veil of dark rain clouds that had stealthily crept in. The once-visible luminescence of Zalem flickered and vanished, leaving **The Scrapyard** cloaked in an oppressive darkness.

The midnight hustle—a hallmark of the entertainment district in the northern part of town—faded swiftly as the impending thunderstorm prompted people to retreat to their shops and homes. The vibrant nightlife dimmed, shadows lengthening under the cover of night.

As Calico turned a familiar corner in a back alley of the entertainment district, she encountered an unexpected obstacle: a narrow path, less than a meter and a half wide, carved by the gaps between tightly packed buildings. The alley's confinement was eerie, its walls pressing in as if to suffocate any sound beyond its narrow confines.

Entering the dim, unlit passage, Calico knew she would reach the back door of the Pink Cabaret—where her bed awaited—in less than a minute without much effort.

As she approached the door, her hand brushed against the cold doorknob. Suddenly, a scraping sound echoed from deep within the alley, sending a chill down her spine.

"...What's that?"

Calico squinted, attempting to pierce the hazy darkness. In the claustrophobic space where neither streetlights nor neon signs penetrated, her vision was limited to mere meters ahead.

"Was it just her imagination? No."

A rumble of thunder shook every corner of the alley. The dark clouds above began to unleash a torrential downpour, the rain lashing against Calico with a deafening roar.

Unwilling to ignore the unknown presence, Calico released the doorknob, her senses sharpening to the depths of the alley's darkness. The pounding rain did nothing to deter her focus.

Though the sound was muffled by the rain and the figure remained hidden, Calico's beast-like instincts detected the approaching presence. A strange unease resonated within her heart, an instinctive alarm that something was amiss.

Fixing her gaze into the abyss, Calico lifted the hem of her drenched coat, revealing a steel gun that shimmered faintly in the rain. She methodically pulled the bolt lever on the rear of the weapon, the heavy mechanical sounds punctuating the storm's fury. A used battery cartridge was ejected from the port.

Calico rifled through her coat's inner pocket, her tongue clicking softly as she confirmed the status of her ammunition. Earlier in the night, she had expended three cartridges, including the pre-heating rounds necessary for her "Red Heat Leg"—a specialized weapon designed to unleash destructive power through high-temperature blades. The limitation of this system was clear: without additional cartridges, the thermal blade's effectiveness waned quickly. With only one cartridge remaining, she relied on the residual heat from her previous confrontation with Colt's gang.

Taking a deep breath and steeling herself, Calico loaded the last cartridge. Tension coiled in the air as her soaked body trembled with a fearless laugh. With subtle, almost imperceptible movements, she shifted her stance—opening her legs slightly forward and backward—a minimal adjustment granting her the agility needed for what was to come.

Another clap of thunder shattered the night, and a thick, blue lightning bolt streaked across the sky, momentarily illuminating the scene in an eerie azure light. Even the boldest Kyarriko couldn't help but groan at the spectacle.

A bolt of lightning cast a fleeting, ghostly glow over the alley, revealing a woman standing there. She glistened in the torrential rain, her skin slick with water, but it wasn't her attire that made her grotesque. Both her arms had been brutally severed at the shoulders, streams of blood trailing down her body and staining the ground in vivid red. A single, deep slash ran from her chest to her navel, her intestines protruding like a macabre sash clinging to her legs. Despite the massive blood loss and unimaginable pain, she remained alive, her breaths shallow and ragged as she staggered forward.

"Sh—Shig..." Kyarriko gasped, instantly recognizing the disfigured woman before her. The battered and bloodied Shig, beaten by the storm, was unmistakably the old prostitute from their shared past.

Shig had likely dragged her ravaged body through the alley, driven by desperation to reach Calico. At the sound of her strangled voice, her remaining strength surged, and she collapsed slowly, sliding down into the blood-soaked alleyway, leaning against the grimy wall.

As Calico prepared to move toward the fallen Shig, a strange, grinding noise emanated from the darkness behind her. Even over the torrential rain, the sound was distinct. Calico's eyes flared with anger as she glared into the gloom behind Shig. The narrow alley offered no visibility, and the eerie grinding noise seemed to originate from the very shadows themselves.

Calico crouched, her body coiled and ready for any attack. She subtly adjusted her stance, shifting her weight from her back foot to the ball of her front foot. Leaning slightly forward, she sacrificed some linear movement for the ability to initiate her attack with greater speed. Her face remained stoic, masking the rising anxiety beneath her calm exterior.

Calmly shifting from defense to offense, Calico spoke in a low, deliberate voice. "Come out, you murderer of prostitutes. I know you're there, aren't you?" Her killing intent radiated into the darkness, a probing force searching for any sign of the hidden presence. The density of her intent was enough to make most faint or panic, but the shadows remained silent, absorbing her aggression like an unyielding void.

Calico's eyes narrowed as she attempted to gauge the strength of her invisible opponent, who watched her like a phantom. "Who is this?" she wondered internally.

After a brief pause, as if growing bored with the silence, the figure began to move. From behind Shig's collapsed form, a steel hand emerged quietly, the long, thin fingers reaching out without a sound. Casually, the hand grasped Shig's hair, lifting her effortlessly into the air. Without warning, a blinding surge of killing intent erupted from the depths of the shadows, crashing into Calico's senses like a tidal wave. In an instant, a sharp, angular presence launched a vicious attack from an elevated position within the darkness. The pivot foot spun sharply as it struck, rising nearly thirty centimeters into the air mid-kick.

The swift, devastating kick sliced through Shig's torso with ease. As her body split apart, Shig let out a strained, agonized cry, her voice breaking under the pain. "Aghh... oh no, how could you do this... so cruel..."

"You… you're no ordinary person, are you?" The figure, a grotesque old man whose steel hands had just ended Shig's life, stepped from the shadows. His appearance was a horrifying reflection of the madness that fueled a serial killer.

His face was concealed beneath wild, tangled white hair, revealing only his wrinkled, twisted mouth in a sneer. Below his unsettling visage, his body had been replaced with a genderless, female-style cyborg frame. His left arm, a multi-jointed exoskeleton resembling the segmented legs of a centipede, could extend and contract with unnerving precision.

The only garment he wore was a scrap of fabric, with large machete-like knives dangling menacingly from his waist on either side.

"Shut up… I don't mix personal feelings with my hunts, you hear?" Calico narrowed her eyes, licking her full red lips with a long, sleek tongue. The old man clicked his tongue in disapproval, muttering softly, "What a waste…" He grinned darkly beneath his mess of white hair before speaking again.

Calico remained silent, attempting to calm the storm raging within her as she faced Norinco. The old man, wheezing and cackling, continued, "Well then, let's see what you’ve got, eh?"

Calico exuded a menacing aura, coiled like a serpent ready to strike, while the fierce rain poured between the narrow gaps of surrounding buildings. Their clash resembled two writhing serpents, bodies moving with deadly precision as they splashed through the pooling water beneath them. Thunder cracked as Calico's elegant kicks illuminated the scene, revealing Norinco's cunning evasive maneuvers in the intermittent flashes of lightning.

"How long are you going to keep playing around, huh? Weren't you supposed to finish me off?" Calico taunted, her voice filled with deadly intent.

Norinco responded with a mocking laugh. "Hissss... Ah, you're strong, girl. I can't believe you had such a hidden move."

Panting heavily, Calico launched herself forward, aiming to strike. Norinco, still in his low stance, moved sideways with eerie fluidity, slipping across the ground like a shadow. It was as though his movements were vines wrapping around a tree, expertly intercepting Calico's incoming kick. Manipulating her momentum, he aimed to throw her off balance, seizing the moment to close the distance between them. Once close, Norinco began delivering sharp, slicing blows with precision. Calico, gritting her teeth, fought back desperately, using her elbows and knees to counter his relentless attacks.

"Damn it!" Calico cursed as she struggled against Norinco's mysterious fighting style. Though she managed to fend off severe damage with desperate defense, she was nearing her limit against the elderly man's refined techniques.

"Hissss... Ah, seems like you're used to attacking from a distance, aren't you? But you've never dealt with someone up close, have you? In close combat, your skills are quite sloppy," Norinco taunted, sliding with confidence.

Calico clicked her tongue in irritation, shaking her wild, disheveled white hair. She delivered a fierce front kick into Norinco's torso. The old man quickly crossed his arms to block the blow, bending his body like a hinge as he deliberately leapt backward. Though he was sent flying several meters, skidding across the wet ground, he managed to halt his descent without taking significant damage.

"Too bad... There's no next time to try again. Hissss... Don't panic now. Even with those dull eyes of yours struggling to keep up, you're putting in the effort, huh?" Norinco hissed mockingly.

Calico remained silent, fighting to maintain her composure as she pushed herself harder, her frustration mounting at her inability to land a decisive blow.

The rain intensified, adding a rhythmic drumming to the cacophony of their battle. Suddenly, Calico's most powerful move—a red-hot thermal blade strike—activated. Drawing power from her last battery cartridge, the thirty-centimeter electric heat blade hidden in her calf sprang forth like a jackknife, aimed directly at Norinco’s exposed skull.

The speed, angle, timing, and power of the strike were flawless. It was one of the best executions of her "Red Heat Leg" in her lifetime. A dull metallic sound rang out, echoing off the walls.

"...Impossible," Calico muttered, breaking the silence.

Norinco's eyes gleamed as he witnessed the near-miss. The blade, cooled by the rain, had been stopped just short of his skull by the massive knife hanging from his waist. The blade, now blackened, emitted a faint sizzling sound as water vaporized on contact. Meanwhile, Norinco’s thick-bladed knife, having taken the brunt of the thermal blade, was almost eighty percent melted through, bent into an "L" shape. It was a near-miss for Norinco.

"Hoo, hoo, hoo... You really impress me. I can’t believe you had such a hidden move," Norinco wheezed, laughing. "But in the face of my dissection knife, well... it didn’t amount to much."

Calico's fatal blow had been thwarted by Norinco's quick reaction and the durability of his special steel blade. The relentless rain had cooled her thermal blade, reducing its effectiveness, and her lack of additional cartridges prevented her from maintaining the blade's high temperature.

"Sheesh, I don’t wanna fight someone like you any longer. How about I hang you up now and finish this once and for all?" Norinco sneered.

Calico, exhausted from her all-out attack, was no match for Norinco—the master of combat. Effortlessly countering her last attempts to fight back, Norinco closed in and delivered a precise blow to her jaw, rendering her unconscious. Grabbing her red hair with his multi-jointed left arm, he dragged her helplessly along the alley wall.

"Hee hee... Let's see, a good wall or a bad wall? I can tell from the sound waves... Hmmm... Heh, this one’s good. Sweet sound waves, just the right resonance. My hand blade will pierce nicely here," he taunted.

Lifting Calico with ease, Norinco hurled her tall frame against the wall. His multi-jointed arm coiled and shot forward like a steel spring, his long, razor-like fingers piercing through her cyborg body, pinning her to the wall.

"Cyborgs don’t scream in pain when you dismantle them, which is boring... but I'll take my time disassembling you piece by piece," Norinco declared with a sadistic grin.

Calico, barely conscious, struggled to escape, but her body no longer responded to her commands. It was now a lifeless mass of steel. Meanwhile, Norinco tossed his broken knife into the river. All Calico could do was glare weakly as Norinco drew a new one.

"Shyyyaaahhh!"

The large knife, sharp as a blade, showed no mercy as it dug into Calico’s defenseless cyborg body. The same tough special steel that had withstood her heated blade was now being chipped away by the heavy, grinding strikes of Norinco's knife. Each blow echoed off the walls as they bit deeper into her body.

With each frenzied strike, Norinco’s knife hacked through Calico’s left arm, severing it below the elbow, while her right leg dangled loosely, nearly torn off. Her once powerful body was reduced to a tattered mess, the outer casing shattered and mangled.

"Kyyaaah!"

Norinco delivered the final blow—a brutal diagonal slash that cleaved her body apart. The twenty-centimeter-long blade sunk deeply into the steel frame of her torso, tearing through her cyborg body like a rag. Her right side and head, now shredded like worn-out fabric, fell from the wall and rolled across the wet ground, coming to rest against the sewer grate.

"......."

Calico, regaining a small measure of consciousness after the shock of her fall, desperately dragged herself along the ground with her remaining tattered right arm, fighting for survival.

"Ssshh, still conscious, are you?" Norinco muttered as he noticed Calico's movement. She had spotted a tear in the metal fence and was pulling her broken body toward it. The old man quickly threw a knife to stop her, but it only managed to pin a part of her torn cyborg frame to the ground. Calico continued to slip away, tumbling into the sewer river and vanishing into the raging current.

"Sssh... I'll give you that, your determination is admirable. But surviving that current with a body like yours would truly be a miracle."

The deep sewer river, swollen with rainwater, roared like a wild torrent, surging violently. Covered in his shaggy white hair, the twisted killer Norinco took a final glance before merging into the shadows of the rain-soaked alleyway, his eerie wheezing fading away into the storm.

As the dark clouds above Zalem began to dissipate, revealing glimpses of the moon through the thinning rain, Calico's lifeless body floated helplessly in the sewer's turbulent waters. The rain continued to lash against the walls of **The Scrapyard**, creating a relentless symphony of sound and motion.

Ido Daisuke, unaware of the night's gruesome events, was still focused on his work. His clinic, a beacon of technology and hope amidst the decay, buzzed with activity as he continued his efforts to restore Gally's fragmented existence. The storm outside mirrored the turmoil within the city, where old grudges and hidden vendettas simmered beneath the surface.

Far above, in the ethereal heights of Zalem, the city's once-glittering facade now lay muted under the storm's cloak. The continuous dump of waste from the broken pillar had transformed the landscape below, turning it into a sprawling slag heap that mirrored the chaos above.

Back in the shadows of **The Scrapyard**, Calico's demise was a silent testament to the brutal reality of their world—a place where alliances were fleeting, and survival often meant the extinguishing of rivals.

As the rain began to ease, the oppressive atmosphere lifted slightly, but the scars of the night's violence remained etched into the city's fabric. **The Scrapyard** was a living entity, its heartbeat synchronized with the rhythm of endless battles and unending strife.

Norinco's retreat into the darkness left behind a trail of destruction, a warning to anyone who dared to challenge his dominance. His actions were a dark reminder that in this forsaken place, mercy was a luxury few could afford.

Meanwhile, Gally's fragmented consciousness stirred within the sewer's depths, her journey far from over. The storm had washed away some of the night's horrors, but new challenges awaited her in the shadows of **The Scrapyard**.

And as the first light of dawn began to pierce through the lingering clouds, **The Scrapyard** prepared itself for another day of struggle, where the remnants of the past clashed with the hopes of the future.
