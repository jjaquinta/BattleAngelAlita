Gally dodged the inaccurately thrown knives with calm precision and swiftly closed the distance. With a sharp jab, she pierced the face of the man with the 76,000 chip bounty, killing him instantly. She shook off the blood splattering from her fist and quietly exhaled. The fear she had felt before the fight had vanished like mist, leaving her in a composed state of mind, as if she were walking through her living room.

"One more left." As Gally turned her gaze toward the counter, a high-pitched scream escaped the last remaining target, the woman with the 81,000 chip bounty. The woman backed away in terror, clutching a pile of chips. Bottles crashed to the floor from the liquor shelf behind her, shattering loudly.

"P-please, spare me!" the woman begged through her tears, desperately placing a pile of chips on the counter. "There are 100,000 chips here. If you let me live, I'll give you another 50,000. Come on, it’s better than turning my head in to the Factory, right? Look, you want these chips, don’t you?"
