Ido, swinging horizontally, stepped into the alley, putting power into his right foot and using it as a pivot to swing his upper body with full force.
It was like a flower blooming.
The sound of a thud mixed with a crunching noise as the sharp end of the hammer struck one of the crouching women. The moment the tip lodged into the womanâ€™s forehead, pink sparks scattered from the back of her head. She fell flat on her back, and it looked as if pale peach-colored brain matter flowers were blooming on the ground around her.
"Screeeeeech!"
Reeling from Ido's surprise attack, the surviving woman let out a breath of anger, gritting her teeth and bristling her hair.
"Roooaaaar!"
Ido quickly raised his hammer again and, without hesitation, swung it down from above with all his might. As the impact traveled through the handle, Ido felt a sharp, needle-like pain and numbness in his hands.
Did I kill her!?
