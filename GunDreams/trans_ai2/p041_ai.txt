“Na…mae?” The girl, still groggy, cast a sleepy gaze at Ido but made no attempt to answer. She had completely lost her memory during her long period of inactivity. Ido didn’t look particularly concerned, smiling softly and shaking his head. 

“That’s okay, you’ll remember in time. Once we fix up your body and you gradually start experiencing the world outside,” he said, pausing for a moment before nodding at the girl, who was still staring at him with that dreamy expression.

“From today, your name will be Gally.” 

The girl, drawn in by Ido’s smile, smiled back. Having lost everything, she felt no discomfort or confusion, simply happy to accept the name Ido had given her. The name “Gally” came from a male cat Ido had owned and who had died the previous year. 

Five days passed since the girl had woken up and been given the name Gally.
