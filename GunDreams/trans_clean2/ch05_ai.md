### Chapter 5

At the same moment Gally and Calico left the Factory District behind, a solitary figure made her way along the shadowed expanse of Tempest Street. It was Shig, the middle-aged prostitute, her footsteps echoing softly in the quiet night.

"I hope that man, Ido, truly understands Gally," she murmured to herself.

Shig moved quietly through the deserted streets. Earlier, she had visited Ido Daisuke's clinic to deliver a message from Calico, informing him that Gally had become a Hunter-Warrior and was now with Calico in the pleasure district.

"I have preparations to make. You may return now," Ido had said curtly before closing the door. Shig shrugged off his brusque demeanor. Since Calico hadn't instructed her to guide him further, she decided to make her way back alone.

She passed through Tempest Street and entered a narrow alleyway—a shortcut leading back to the heart of the pleasure district. The alley was scarcely a meter wide, twisting and turning like a labyrinth. Without streetlights, it was a maze shrouded in darkness, but for those who knew the way, it offered a swift path, cutting the journey time in half compared to the main roads.

As Shig navigated the winding passage, a peculiar sound echoed off the grimy walls—a faint, abrasive noise like something being dragged or rubbed together.

"What is that sound?" she whispered, furrowing her brow. An uneasy feeling settled in the pit of her stomach.

A sudden chill ran down her spine, as if icy fingers had grazed her back.

"Ah!"

The unsettling friction noise seemed to draw nearer, creeping ever closer, like the stealthy approach of a predator.

"Ah... ah... ah... aah..."

Her breath quickened. The sound slithered through the darkness, a sinister whisper that set her nerves on edge.

Drenched in cold sweat, Shig quickened her pace, her footsteps echoing in the narrow alley. She turned right, then left, navigating the maze by instinct, resisting the urge to glance over her shoulder.

The oppressive silence was broken only by the relentless sound pursuing her.

Out of breath, she rounded another corner.

"Ah..."

Ahead, at the far end of the alley, a small, flickering light glimmered—a beacon in the darkness.

Relief washed over her, and a smile touched her lips.

Calico exhaled a stream of smoke as she lit the cigarette between her lips, her gaze fixed on Ido.

"So, what's your take on all this?" she asked.

Ido didn't respond immediately. He sat beside the unconscious Gally, gently stroking her hair. After a moment, he began to speak, almost as if to himself.

"I don't know much about Panzer Kunst," he admitted. "But I've heard it's a legendary martial art—one that was feared and eventually eradicated because of its terrifying power. They called it the ancient Martian martial art for a reason."

He paused, his eyes distant.

"In the old spacefaring days, humanity reached out to Venus, Mars, Jupiter—we built unique cultures on each planet. On Mars, the practitioners of Panzer Kunst wielded immense power in wars, mastering assassinations and guerrilla tactics. The saying went, 'On Mars, there is Panzer Kunst.' They were feared."

Calico nodded thoughtfully. "I see... The principles are quite different from our Earth-style martial arts. Watching Gally move, it's clear her techniques aren't confined to ground-based combat. It's as if she's fighting in three dimensions."

She approached Gally, who lay peacefully in Ido's arms. Gently, Calico placed a hand on the girl's cheek, a gesture that seemed affectionate. But Ido felt a chill. Beneath Calico's calm exterior, he sensed a simmering hostility.

"Calico, you..." Ido murmured, his expression darkening.

He turned slightly, positioning himself between Calico and Gally. His voice trembled with a restrained urgency.

"I won't let you see Gally anymore. After seeing your eyes just now, I'm convinced. If you and Gally stay around each other, it's only a matter of time before you try to kill each other."

Calico was momentarily taken aback. Then, a dry chuckle escaped her lips.

"Perhaps you're right," she conceded. "She is a remarkable girl, but I've just realized I don't like her very much. Make sure you tell her not to come after me, okay?"

She turned away, her silhouette melding into the shadows of the alley.

Ido watched her go, a heavy weight settling in his chest. He knew Calico's fierce temperament and immense pride as a warrior. She couldn't tolerate the presence of someone who might rival or surpass her skills. If Gally continued to grow stronger, a confrontation between them seemed inevitable—a clash between two titans bound by fate.

After Calico disappeared into the depths of the night, Ido began the journey home, carrying Gally gently in his arms. The streets were quiet, the air cool against his skin. After a few steps, he hesitated. Turning back toward the alley, his gaze searched the darkness.

"Calico's hostility is more dangerous to Gally than Colt's twisted obsession," he thought aloud. "If only I had the power to stop her here and now..."

He clenched his fist, frustration gnawing at him. But he knew the truth. He lacked the strength to confront Calico, let alone defeat her.

"All I can do is protect Gally as best I can," he whispered, his voice tinged with bitterness.

He resumed walking, the sound of his footsteps absorbed by the silent city.

Unbeknownst to him, the seeds of conflict had already been sown, and the shadow of impending danger loomed larger than ever.

Some distance away, in the labyrinth of alleys, Shig's smile faded as she realized the flickering light was not a friendly beacon but something else entirely.

A sense of dread crept over her.

"Who's there?" she called out tentatively.

The only response was the eerie echo of her own voice.

She took a cautious step forward, her instincts urging her to flee, but curiosity anchored her feet.

From the shadows, a figure emerged, the dim light casting ominous silhouettes.

Shig's heart pounded. She recognized the glint in the stranger's eyes—a cold, predatory gaze.

"No... it can't be," she whispered.

The friction sound that had pursued her now resonated loudly, a chilling symphony of metal and menace.

As the reality of her situation sank in, Shig's thoughts turned briefly to Gally and Ido.

"I hope they find peace," she murmured.

The alley swallowed her words, and the darkness closed in.

---

That night, unseen by most, a quiet storm gathered over **The Scrapyard**. Threads of fate intertwined, setting in motion events that would alter lives and destinies.

And as the city slept, whispers of change drifted through the air—a prelude to the trials yet to come.
