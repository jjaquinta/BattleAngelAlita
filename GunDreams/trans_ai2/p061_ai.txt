As Gally darted through the crowd, a soft voice unexpectedly called out to her. She hesitated for a moment before stopping and turning toward the source of the voice. There, she saw a plump woman standing still, waving her hand with a smile. Her face was thickly covered in bright makeup, giving her a charming, raccoon-like appearance.

"Um, are you... an old lady?" Gally asked the woman, but she didn’t answer. Instead, she gently grabbed Gally’s hand and pulled her into a narrow alley. It was the backside of the entertainment district, a filthy, dimly lit alley strewn with garbage.

"For now, you’ll be safe here for a bit. No one will find you," the woman said. "I'm just a lowly prostitute named Shigu. What about you, honey?"

"Uh... Gally," she replied.

It seemed Shigu had seen everything—how Gally had been hassled by the bull-headed cyborg. That man, known as Colt, was the leader of a gang of thugs in the area, notorious for causing trouble. While he wasn’t officially a wanted man, rumors said he had already killed a few people in the shadows.
