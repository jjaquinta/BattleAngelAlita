The process of this shadow's perfectly executed maneuver took only a fraction of a second. After confirming the man was about to swing down his machete, the shadow unleashed what could only be described as a divine, artistic technique. However, it wasn't just the graceful kick — could it also possess the capability to sever so cleanly? Not only did the shadow's skill in kicking excel, but its reflexes had reached god-like levels.

Yet — a question still lingered.

No matter how artistic the technique, could a mere kick sever the steel wrist of a cyborg? It seemed as though there was something else behind the shadow’s advanced kicking technique. When the man began to sense this vague and immense presence, it was already too late — the shadow had its foot planted firmly on his back.

Pressed face-down into the ground, glaring at his hated pursuer, the man desperately twisted his neck to look up and saw a tall, slender figure, with silver-framed glasses and crimson eyes.

"Cali, damn you!"

Still pinned face-down, struggling to lift his gaze, what he saw at the edge of his vision was a slender figure with silver-rimmed glasses and red eyes.
