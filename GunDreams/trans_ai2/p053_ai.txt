Gally dimmed the lights in her room and slipped under the bed covers, but she couldnâ€™t fall asleep right away. About two hours later, as she was finally on the verge of drifting off after wrestling with her restless mind, she heard a sound. It was small, but oddly vivid, and it knocked on the door of Gally's consciousness. 

What could that be, at this hour? As her mind began to clear, Gally realized the sharp, rhythmic sound she was hearing was the sound of shoes tapping against the floor. She opened her eyes slightly in the dim room, which was illuminated surprisingly well by the moonlight. 

Slowly, she sat up in bed and listened carefully. The sound of footsteps passed by her room and descended the stairs. After a short while, she faintly heard the door to the clinic open and close. 

Gally slipped out of bed and quietly walked over to the curtained window. Gently lifting the edge of the curtain, she peeked outside. From the dim light, she saw a figure leaving the clinic and heading out into the street.
