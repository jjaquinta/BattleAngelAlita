"But the client just had to grab onto a clue, huh? Sorry, but I can't stay quiet about this, you know?"
Gally's face broke out in a cold sweat, and she shuddered. The fact that the skilled kicker standing before her was targeting Ido became all too clear.
"Even if Ido were a murderer, there's no way I'm going to let them kill him!"
As Gally shouted, she leaped into the red-haired woman's chest in a single motion.
"Oh? You mean Ido? Ugh!"
The red-haired woman widened her eyes behind her glasses at Gally's words. That caused a split-second delay in her defense against the kick Gally had unleashed, spinning like a tornado. Unable to fully block the force, the red-haired woman was knocked back and rolled away.
"Take this!"
Seizing the opportunity, Gally aimed a high-angle kick at the red-haired woman as she started to rise. The speed of the kick sliced through the air, making a high-pitched whistling sound.
In that instant, sparks flew in the dimly lit alleyway.
