Gally silently approached the woman, grabbed her collar across the counter, and lifted her up. "The chips don't matter," Gally said softly. The woman, her face filled with disbelief, kicked and struggled helplessly in midair. "P-please, don’t kill me! I don’t want to die yet!" Gally held the pathetic, flailing woman aloft for a moment, then shifted her gaze and carelessly released her. The woman collapsed backward, her face a mess of tears and snot, paralyzed by fear.

"You're not the kind of opponent I’m looking for," Gally said, turning her back on the woman, who sat on the floor in relief, her legs too weak to stand. Without bothering to take the bounty, Gally began to leave the wrecked bar.

"Hmph..." At the very moment Gally turned her back, the woman's expression drastically changed. The once pathetic figure, covered in tears and snot, now radiated fury, her face contorted with rage, emanating a violent, ominous aura that made her seem like a completely different person.
