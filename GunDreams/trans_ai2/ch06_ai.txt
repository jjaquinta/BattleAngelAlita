CHAPTER 6

"Late that night, the towering lights of the aerial city Zalem above The Scrapyard vanished as soon as they were enveloped by a veil of thick, dark rain clouds that had crept in.

The midnight bustle—a hallmark of the entertainment district in the northern part of town—also quickly disappeared as people hurried back to their shops and homes at the hint of an impending thunderstorm.

When Calico turned a corner in a familiar back alley of the entertainment district, she found not a continuation of the road but a narrow path less than a meter and a half wide, created by the gaps between buildings.

Entering the dim, unlit path, she would arrive at the back door of the Pink Cabaret, where her bed was, in less than a minute without walking much.

As Calico reached the back door and placed her hand on the doorknob, her ears caught a scraping sound echoing from deep within the alley.

'...What's that?'"

"Calico squinted her eyes, trying to discern the hazy distance, but in this narrow space between buildings where neither streetlights nor neon lights reached, she could see at most ten meters ahead.

"Was it just her imagination? No.

The rumble of thunder shook every corner of the alley. At that moment, thunderclouds that had suddenly gathered overhead began pouring heavy rain upon Calico with a deafening sound.

Calico chose not to ignore that unknown presence. Releasing her hand from the doorknob, she focused her sharpened senses into the depths of the alley's darkness, paying no mind to the pounding rain.

Though the sound was drowned out by the rain and the figure was hidden in the darkness, Calico's beast-like keen senses surely detected the approaching presence. She wasn't certain whether it was dangerous, but a strange unease sounded an alarm in her heart.

Keeping her gaze fixed into the depths of the darkness, Calico lifted the hem of her wet and heavy coat, revealing a steel gun that gave off a dull shine in the rain. As she slowly pulled the bolt lever on the rear part of the machine, with a heavy operating sound, a used battery cartridge was ejected from the ejection port."


Calico rummaged through the inside pocket of her coat and confirmed it, clicking her tongue softly. In the earlier fight, she had used three cartridges, including the pre-heating rounds, of the red-hot power supply. The "Red Heat Leg" was a gimmick designed to exert destructive power through the high heat generated by an internal electric blade, but its weakness was that the special steel blade cooled down quickly, making it difficult to maintain a high temperature. To use it, pre-heating was necessary, and to expect full power, she would need more battery cartridges. However, with only one cartridge left, she had no choice but to rely on the residual heat from when it was last used in the battle with Colt's gang.

Taking a deep breath and steeling herself, Calico finished loading the last cartridge. As the tension in the air heightened, her soaked body trembled with a fearless laugh. With subtle movements that were almost imperceptible, she lightly shifted her stance by opening her legs just slightly forward and backward. This was all she could do for now.

Just then, another clap of thunder roared, and with it, a thick, blue lightning bolt filled with intense energy cut through the sky.
ow if you need any further translations or clarifications!

A bolt of lightning illuminated the scene for a brief moment, casting it in an eerie blue light, and even the bold Kyarriko couldn't help but let out a low groan. 

The figure standing there was a woman. She glistened in the torrential rain, her skin slick with the water. But it wasn't her nudity that made her so grotesque. Both of her arms had been brutally severed at the shoulders, leaving streams of blood running down her body and painting the ground in red. A single slash ran from her chest down to her navel, her intestines, stained pink with blood, spilling out like a grotesque sash clinging to her legs. Despite the massive blood loss and unimaginable pain, she was somehow still alive, wheezing with shallow breaths as she staggered forward.

"Sh—Shig..." Kyarriko immediately recognized who the woman was. The disfigured woman, beaten and bloodied in the storm, was undoubtedly Shig—the old prostitute she had known since their early days together.


Shig had likely dragged her ruined body all the way here, desperate to reach Calico. At the sound of her strangled voice, it seemed to trigger the last of her strength, and she collapsed slowly, sliding down into the blood-soaked alleyway, leaning against the wall. 

As Calico prepared to move toward the falling Shig, a strange, grinding noise emerged from the darkness behind her, distinct even over the torrential rain. Calico's eyes flared with anger as she glared into the gloom behind Shig. The narrow alley was filled with nothing but darkness, the source of the eerie grinding noise barely noticeable, hiding itself in the shadows.

Calico, crouched and ready for any attack, subtly shifted her stance. She adjusted her weight slightly, moving it from her back foot to the ball of her front foot. By leaning her weight slightly forward, she sacrificed some of her linear movement but gained the ability to initiate her attack much faster. Though her face remained focused, she concealed her rising anxiety beneath a mask of calm readiness.

Calmly shifting her tactics from defensive to offensive, Calico spoke in a low, deliberate voice. "Come out, you murderer of prostitutes. I know you're there, aren't you?" She sent out a wave of killing intent into the darkness, probing for the presence of whoever was hiding there. The density of her killing intent was enough to make most people faint as if struck by lightning or rush at her in a panic. But there was no response from the shadows, not even a hint of a breeze.

The eerie presence lurking in the dimness absorbed Calico's intent like a reed bending to the wind, unaffected and utterly silent. Calico's eyes narrowed as she tried to gauge the strength of this invisible opponent, who was watching her like a phantom. Who is this? she wondered.

After a brief pause, as though it had grown bored of the silence, the figure began to move. From the darkness behind Shig's collapsed form, a steel hand quietly slithered out. Only the long, thin fingers of a cyborg hand emerged from the shadows, reaching out without a sound, casually grabbing hold of Shig's hair.

The figure suddenly lifted Shig nearly three meters into the air, effortlessly hoisting her up. Then, without warning, a blinding surge of killing intent emanated from deep within the shadows, crashing into Calico's senses like a tidal wave. In an instant, a sharp, angular presence launched a vicious attack from an elevated position in the shadows. The pivot foot spun sharply as it struck, rising almost 30 centimeters into the air mid-kick.

The swift, devastating kick sliced through Shig's torso with ease. As her body split apart, Shig let out a strained, agonized cry, her voice breaking. "Aghh... oh no, how could you do this... so cruel..."

"You… you're no ordinary person, are you?" The figure of the old man, whose grotesque, steel hands had just euthanized Shig, stepped out from the shadows, emitting strange, wheezing breaths. In the pouring rain, Calico watched as this small, elderly, full-body cyborg emerged into her line of sight. Despite his size, his appearance was a horrifying reflection of the madness that drove a serial killer.

His face was hidden beneath wild, tangled white hair, with only his wrinkled, twisted mouth visible in a sneer. Below his unsettling head, his body had been replaced with a genderless, female-style cyborg frame. His left arm, replaced from shoulder to wrist with a horrifying, multi-jointed machine resembling the segmented exoskeleton of a centipede, was capable of extending and contracting.

The only clothing this grotesque old man wore was a scrap of fabric, with large machete-like knives dangling from his waist on either side. 

"Shut up… I don't mix personal feelings with my hunts, you hear?" Calico narrowed her eyes, licking her full red lips with a long tongue. At her words, the old man clicked his tongue in disapproval, muttering softly, "What a waste…" He grinned darkly beneath his mess of white hair and slowly spoke again.

Calico remained silent, trying to gauge the old man's intentions, calming the storm within her. The old man, wheezing and cackling, continued, "Well then, let's see what you’ve got, eh?" 

Calico exuded a menacing aura, like a coiled serpent ready to strike, while the fierce rain poured between the narrow gaps of the surrounding buildings. Calico and the old man, who had introduced himself as Norinco, clashed like two writhing serpents, their bodies moving with deadly precision as they splashed through the pooling water beneath them. Thunder cracked as Calico's elegant kicks lit up the scene, revealing Norinco's cunning evasive maneuvers in the flashes of lightning.

"How long are you going to keep playing around, huh? Weren't you supposed to finish me off?" Calico taunted, her voice filled with deadly intent.

Calico shouted mockingly at Norinco as she attacked fiercely. The old man, wheezing and making a hissing friction sound from his mouth, had barely launched half the attacks that Calico had so far. Every now and then, Calico's relentless kicks would land because Norinco couldn't entirely deflect the overwhelming onslaught. From an outside perspective, it appeared that Calico was completely dominating Norinco, who was only defending.

"Come on! Fight back a little, will ya?" she taunted.

However, despite her apparent upper hand, Calico hadn't inflicted any significant damage on Norinco. The old man expertly blocked her attacks, either deflecting them with his hands or adjusting his position just enough to avoid taking serious hits. Sparks would fly every time her kicks grazed his steel arms or torso, but it was all show—there was no real damage being done. 

Internally, Calico struggled to remain calm as she fought desperately, her frustration building at the sight of Norinco standing unfazed after every strike. She pushed herself harder, trying to keep her composure but feeling increasingly irritated at her inability to land a decisive blow.

"Hiss... You're strong, girl. But you've got no luck at all. Whether you realize it or not, you're holding back just a bit, afraid of slipping on the wet ground. I can see it in your kicks," Norinco hissed, mocking her further. "Your precious kicks are crying, girl."

Calico clicked her tongue in irritation and, shaking her wild, disheveled white hair, she landed a fierce front kick into Norinco's torso. The old man quickly crossed his arms to block the blow, bending his body like a hinge as he deliberately leapt backward. Though he was sent flying several meters, skidding across the wet ground, he managed to stop himself without taking any significant damage.

"Too bad... There's no next time to try again. Hissss... Don't panic now. Even with those dull eyes of yours struggling to keep up, you're putting in the effort, huh?" Norinco wheezed mockingly.

"Huh? What are you talking about? You can't see...?" Calico, startled, hesitated in her attacks. It was hard to believe that the old man, who had been evading her relentless strikes so easily, was actually blind.

"Hissss... Go on, take a look. Do you see any eyes on me?" The old man rasped, pushing aside the tangled white hair that covered his face with both hands.

Calico's breath caught in her throat as she stared in shock at the strange sight beneath his hair. In place of eyes, the old man had nothing but small, white dish-like objects where his eyeballs should have been.

"Hisss... Did you catch on yet? These dishes in place of my eyeballs are radar eyes. They visualize ultrasonic waves, allowing me to move easily even in the dark. Though, to be honest, I rely more on intuition and sensing than these gadgets," Norinco said, turning his head as if scanning the surroundings with his radar eyes. He nodded in satisfaction. 

"Hisss... Oh dear, the heavy rain's distorting the sound images a bit, but it looks like we've ended up in a nice spot." 

At some point, Norinco and Calico had emerged from the narrow alley into an open area. 

"This place..." Calico recognized it immediately. In front of them was a wide cul-de-sac, with a chain-link fence at its far end, and beyond that, a deep sewage river flowed. 

This was the same place where she had recently hunted down a junkie, who had turned one of his arms into a cybernetic weapon. His corpse still lay there, rotting on the ground, beaten by the rain, as no one had bothered to clean it up.

Norinco, now in the dead-end alley, had shifted his stance completely. Unlike his earlier defensive posture, he took up a strange and focused pose. He spread his legs wide, lowered his body, and turned almost completely sideways. Then, preparing for something unseen, he waited.

Both of Norinco's hands were shaped like beaks, with his fingers curled and trembling slightly as if they were probing for something. "Hisss... well, well... the worthless trash of this forsaken world. Rejoice, for death is a ceremony that happens only once in a lifetime. Let’s make it memorable by disassembling you piece by piece," he taunted.

At that moment, Calico launched herself forward in a rapid charge, aiming to strike. Norinco, still in his low stance, moved sideways like a crab, sliding across the ground with an eerie fluidity. It was as though his movements were like vines wrapping around a tree, expertly catching Calico's incoming kick. Manipulating her momentum, he tried to throw her off balance, taking advantage of the moment to close the distance between them. Once he was close enough, Norinco began landing sharp, slicing blows with precision. Calico, gritting her teeth, fought back desperately, using her elbows and knees to counter his attacks.

"Damn it!" Calico cursed as she struggled against Norinco's mysterious fighting style. Though she was able to fend off severe damage with desperate defense, she was nearing her limit against the elderly man's refined techniques. 

"Hisss... Ah, seems like you're used to attacking from a distance, aren't you? But you've never dealt with someone up close, have you? In close combat, your skills are quite sloppy," Norinco taunted, slithering with confidence.

Damn... not yet. Calico wasn’t just being tossed around aimlessly—she had secretly triggered the red-hot blade function in her leg when they arrived at this spot. Drawing power from the last battery cartridge, the thirty-centimeter electric heat blade hidden in her right leg was now heating up inside the holster, glowing red-hot. Though she hadn’t preheated it and was relying on residual heat, which lowered its reliability, it was still her trump card with enough destructive power to potentially turn the tide.

"Hisss... Oh, you're planning something, aren't you? Hahaha, go ahead, try to kill me if you can," Norinco sneered, clearly sensing the determined aura emanating from Calico despite her pain.

Panting heavily, Norinco hissed out a breath. The old man, now fully on the defensive like a silkworm in a cocoon, relentlessly struck at Calico with a rapid barrage of sharp finger thrusts. Overjoyed with his advantage, Norinco’s attacks grew increasingly reckless. 

In that moment, for just a split second, the force of his attacks caused his body to shift slightly off balance, tilting his axis away from Calico at a diagonal.

Sensing this in an instant, Calico reacted with the precision of a spider lunging at its prey. She charged forward, slamming her shoulder into Norinco before he could recover his footing. The quick-moving old man, unable to correct his stance in time, stumbled. 

"Sh-shit...!" Norinco gasped, his body thrown off balance.

"Rrrraaaaahhh!" Calico roared as she lunged forward, taking advantage of the opening to close the distance between them.

Calico delivered a decisive kick. If this didn’t end it, she would lose. Throwing her entire body into the attack, her thigh shot upwards like a knee strike, and her lower leg, folded at the knee, unfolded with a sharp downward angle. At the same time, the red-hot thermal blade stored in her calf sprang out like a jackknife, aimed directly at Norinco’s exposed skull.

The speed of the kick, the angle, the timing, and the power—everything about this strike was flawless. It was one of the best executions of Calico's "Red Heat Leg" in her lifetime. 

A dull metallic sound rang out once, echoing off the walls. For a moment, only the heavy rain, the thunder, and the sound of the now-turbulent sewage river filled the space.

"...Impossible," Calico muttered, breaking the silence. Then, low and raspy gasps came from Norinco, mixed with the acrid smell of something burning, followed by his eerie, wheezing laughter.

Unbelievably, Calico's most powerful thermal blade strike was stopped just short of Norinco's skull by the large knife hanging at his waist. The blade, now cooled by the rain, had turned black, emitting a faint sizzling sound as water vaporized on contact. On the other hand, Norinco’s thick-bladed knife, which had taken the brunt of the thermal blade, was almost eighty percent melted through, bent into an "L" shape. It was a near-miss for Norinco.

"Hoo, hoo, hoo... You really impress me. I can’t believe you had such a hidden move," Norinco wheezed, laughing. "But in the face of my dissection knife, well... it didn’t amount to much."

His quick reaction to draw the knife and the durability of the special steel blade had been unlucky for Calico. However, what truly sealed her fate was the rain, which had dragged the fight out and cooled her thermal blade, and the fact that she had no additional cartridges for pre-heating, which prevented the blade from reaching its maximum destructive potential.

"Sheesh, I don’t wanna fight someone like you any longer. How about I hang you up now and finish this once and for all?" Norinco sneered as he prepared to make his move.

Calico, having exhausted all her strength after her all-out attack was thwarted, was no match for Norinco, the master of combat. Effortlessly countering Calico’s last attempts to fight back, the old man closed in and struck a precise blow to her jaw, rendering her unconscious. Grabbing her red hair with his multi-jointed left arm, he dragged her helplessly along the alley wall.

"Hee hee... Let's see, a good wall or a bad wall? I can tell from the sound waves... Hmmm... Heh, this one’s good. Sweet sound waves, just the right resonance. My hand blade will pierce nicely here."

Lifting Calico with ease, Norinco hurled her tall frame against the wall. His multi-jointed arm coiled and shot forward like a steel spring, his long, razor-like fingers piercing through her steel body, pinning her to the wall.

"Cyborgs don’t scream in pain when you dismantle them, which is boring... but I'll take my time disassembling you piece by piece," Norinco said with a sadistic grin.

Calico, barely conscious, tried to escape, but her body no longer responded to her commands. It was now merely a lifeless mass of steel. Meanwhile, Norinco tossed his broken knife into the river...

All Calico could do was glare weakly as Norinco tossed away his broken knife and drew a new one. 

"Shyyyaaahhh!"

The large knife, sharp as a blade, showed no mercy as it dug into Calico’s defenseless cyborg body. The same tough special steel that had withstood her heated blade was now slowly being chipped away by the heavy, grinding strikes of Norinco's knife. The blows echoed off the walls as they bit deeper into her body. 

With each frenzied strike, Norinco’s knife hacked through Calico’s left arm, severing it below the elbow, while her right leg dangled loosely, nearly torn off. Her once powerful body was reduced to a tattered mess, the outer casing shattered and mangled.

"Kyyaaah!"

Norinco delivered the final blow, a brutal diagonal slash that cleaved her body apart. The twenty-centimeter-long blade sunk deeply into the steel frame of her torso, tearing through her cyborg body like a rag. Her right side and head, now shredded like worn-out fabric, fell from the wall and rolled across the wet ground, coming to a stop against the sewer grate.

"......."

Calico, regaining a small amount of control over her paralyzed body after the shock of her fall, desperately dragged herself along the ground with her remaining tattered right arm, trying to survive.

"Ssshh, still conscious, are you?" Norinco muttered as he noticed Calico's movement. She had spotted a tear in the metal fence and was pulling her broken body towards it. The old man quickly threw a knife to stop her, but it only managed to pin a part of her torn cyborg frame to the ground. Calico continued to slip away, tumbling into the sewer river and vanishing into the raging current.

"Sssh... I'll give you that, your determination is admirable. But surviving that current with a body like yours would truly be a miracle."

The deep sewer river, swollen with rainwater, roared like a wild torrent, surging violently. Covered in his shaggy white hair, the twisted killer Norinco took a final glance before merging into the shadows of the rain-soaked alleyway, his eerie wheezing fading away into the storm.
