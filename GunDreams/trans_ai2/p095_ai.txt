"I didn't want you to see me like this... another me who enjoys killing."

As Gally stared at Ido, Calico's hand gently rested on her shoulder.

"I told them to call him for me, you know? I asked Sig and the others to arrange it."

"Heh heh, if you're going to become a Hunter anyway, you need to get proper guardian consent, right? Baby."

With that, Calico began to walk gracefully. There were still about eight of Colt's henchmen blocking the way.

"I'll handle these small fry, okay? It's a huge loss to use this outside of work, but I'll show you as a special treatâ€”my full-power red-hot electromagnetic whip."

Calico suddenly dashed forward as if falling, unleashing a mid-level kick with incredible speed. It wasn't a kick that shot straight upward all at once, but a sweeping kick that cut horizontally.

As her leg extended, a thermal blade that had been stored inside shot out, and with a sizzling sound, she slashed through the bodies of five men at once.

"Ugh!"
