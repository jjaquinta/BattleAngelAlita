Unbelievably, Calico's most powerful thermal blade strike was stopped just short of Norinco's skull by the large knife hanging at his waist. The blade, now cooled by the rain, had turned black, emitting a faint sizzling sound as water vaporized on contact. On the other hand, Norinco’s thick-bladed knife, which had taken the brunt of the thermal blade, was almost eighty percent melted through, bent into an "L" shape. It was a near-miss for Norinco.

"Hoo, hoo, hoo... You really impress me. I can’t believe you had such a hidden move," Norinco wheezed, laughing. "But in the face of my dissection knife, well... it didn’t amount to much."

His quick reaction to draw the knife and the durability of the special steel blade had been unlucky for Calico. However, what truly sealed her fate was the rain, which had dragged the fight out and cooled her thermal blade, and the fact that she had no additional cartridges for pre-heating, which prevented the blade from reaching its maximum destructive potential.

"Sheesh, I don’t wanna fight someone like you any longer. How about I hang you up now and finish this once and for all?" Norinco sneered as he prepared to make his move.
