“The question now is whether I can successfully thaw her from this state,” Ido muttered to himself. He recalled once reading a clinical report from a file in a certain facility, which described a successful case of reversing plastination and reviving the tissue to its original state. He remembered that the report was part of a vast collection of medical data, and it was about a hundred years old.

"Who would've thought that the special knowledge from back then would come in handy now..." Ido touched the mark on his forehead with his finger. It was a symbol, a circle with the top part cut off in a square shape, an emblem from his homeland, engraved on him long ago.

With a sigh, Ido shook his head and refocused, moving swiftly around the operating room once again. It had been a full day since he brought the girl into the surgery room. He had not taken a single break, completely absorbed in working on her. Naturally, the Cyborgenics clinic had been closed for the day. Dressed in a wrinkled white coat, Ido sat beside the still-sleeping girl.
