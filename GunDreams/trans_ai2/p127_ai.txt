Both of Norinco's hands were shaped like beaks, with his fingers curled and trembling slightly as if they were probing for something. "Hisss... well, well... the worthless trash of this forsaken world. Rejoice, for death is a ceremony that happens only once in a lifetime.

At that moment, Calico launched herself forward in a rapid charge, aiming to strike. Norinco, still in his low stance, moved sideways like a crab, sliding across the ground with an eerie fluidity. It was as though his movements were like vines wrapping around a tree, expertly catching Calico's incoming kick. Manipulating her momentum, he tried to throw her off balance, taking advantage of the moment to close the distance between them. Once he was close enough, Norinco began landing sharp, slicing blows with precision. Calico, gritting her teeth, fought back desperately, using her elbows and knees to counter his attacks.
