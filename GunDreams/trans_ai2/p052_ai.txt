"I'm tired today. And with the drink in me... I think I'll head to bed early tonight," Ido said as he stood up from the chair in the living room. Gally tugged at the hem of Ido's jacket and looked up at him with pleading eyes.

"Hey, Ido, are you really going to sleep already? Is the story about the outside world over for today?"

Ever since Gally had gained the ability to move freely, she had been eager to hear various stories from Ido, especially about the outside world. Her curiosity about The Scrapyard was particularly strong, and even the smallest tidbit would make her perk up and listen intently. Since she'd only taken a short walk around the clinic, even the most ordinary stories about the town seemed like grand adventures to her.

"Yeah, sorry, but let's call it a night. I'm really busy right now, but in a couple of days, I'll take you to the lively streets. So, for tonight, try not to stay up too late and get some rest," Ido said as he sluggishly left the living room.

No matter how much Gally puffed her cheeks in dissatisfaction, she had no choice but to return to her room and go to bed. 

"Closing my eyes and having another day end... it feels kind of boring," she muttered to herself.
