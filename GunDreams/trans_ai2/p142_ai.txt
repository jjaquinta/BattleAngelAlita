Gally felt her body twitch for a moment as she took in the scene of destruction. *Am I trembling?* she thought to herself. *What am I scared of? Get a grip.* She mentally repeated these words, trying to calm her body, which was becoming stiff with tension. Gally took a deep breath, silently, so as not to be noticed. 

The three bounty heads who had rampaged through the bar, leaving nothing living behind, were enjoying the aftermath of their violence, completely oblivious to Gally. A man standing against the wall with only his arms and legs cybernetically enhanced, worth a bounty of 60,000 chips, held a bloodstained curved blade in one hand, his unfocused eyes staring blankly into space after taking a hit of synthetic drugs. A second man, worth 76,000 chips, fully cybernetic and clad in a black coat, sat calmly at the counter, pouring himself a glass of bourbon, his demeanor unfitting of the brutal scene around him. The third, a black woman, also fully cybernetic and worth 81,000 chips, was rifling through the bar’s storage, counting the stolen cash she’d found in the safe with obvious glee.

"What a vile thing to do," Gally muttered under her breath.
