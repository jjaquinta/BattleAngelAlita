As Gally rubbed her nose and looked up, there stood a full-body cyborg with the head of a steel bull. The moment Gally tried to slip past him, the bull-headed cyborg intentionally thrust his chest forward.

"Uh... I-I'm sorry."

"Oh, sorry doesn't cut it, little baby! You almost made my delicate heart burst from that impact!"

The bull-headed cyborg pressed his steel chest with both arms and spoke in an exaggerated, angry tone, breathing heavily through his nose. Gally, caught off guard, could do nothing but sit there in confusion.

"Hey, baby, what should I do with you now?" The bull-headed cyborg cracked his knuckles menacingly as he stepped closer, causing Gally to slowly back away. Her entire body trembled in fear, and she frantically looked around for help. S-someone... anyone...

But none of the bystanders who had witnessed the situation made any move to help her. Some averted their eyes, some walked away disinterestedly, and others even smirked with careless curiosity.
