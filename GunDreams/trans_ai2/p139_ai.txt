Gally had obtained the crumpled bounty list two days earlier during the day when she accessed the interface of a Factory security information management robot, "Netman," on the street. *Ido, tonight I’ll go out on my own again, without telling you, and do a perfectly fine job as a Hunter-Warrior. Soon, you’ll recognize that I can handle everything on my own,* she thought to herself.

"Sixty thousand, seventy-six thousand, eighty-one thousand..." Gally mumbled as she repeated the bounty amounts while pushing through the crowd. The three bounties she had spotted were worth 60,000 chips, 76,000 chips, and 81,000 chips, respectively. For Gally, who was still being supported by Ido, these amounts didn't hold much meaning financially. However, using the bounty as a measure of how dangerous the criminals were made it easier for her to remember than just their names.

As Gally followed the trio through the bustling street, pondering when and where she should strike, they suddenly disappeared into one of the small shops lined along the street. "Oh no, I lost them," she muttered, getting swept along by the crowd like a leaf in the wind. After some effort, she finally made her way to the front of the shop. Gally bent over, resting her hands on her knees, taking a deep breath, and then looked up at the shop’s sign.
