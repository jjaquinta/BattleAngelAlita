The woman, her yellow eyes behind her glasses, smiled as she spoke to the man who, completely stripped of his bravado, now trembled in fear from the pain and the terror of death.

"For someone worth only ninety thousand and fifty chips, I didn’t think I’d need to use a cartridge on you. This stuff is expensive, you know?"

The woman lifted the hem of her worn-out coat and showed off the leg with which she was stepping on the man. The mechanical limb, having lost its human-like shape, featured a bolt-like handle and an ejector lever similar to what you'd see on a firearm. With a heavy "click," the woman pulled the bolt, and a cylindrical cartridge was ejected from the sliding shutter.

"It's basically a hidden boning knife, you see. And with this red-hot leg of mine... I'll roast your shin with it, electrically heated."

The man flailed his arms and legs like an insect, screaming in agony.

"Isn’t it nice...? It's lovely, right? The sound of your bones, it’s terrifying, isn’t it?"

The woman delighted in the feeling of the man’s bones cracking beneath her foot, stomping on his back over and over again while licking the blood from the corner of her twisted, cruel smile.
