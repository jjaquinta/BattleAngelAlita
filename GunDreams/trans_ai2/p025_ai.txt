"Was that it?"

The woman blew a puff of cigarette smoke onto the man’s neck. "You got yourself hooked on that old-fashioned junk, mescaline, tripping out and killing workers in your flashy, drug-fueled stupor. That’s why you ended up being hunted by me, right?"

Mescaline is an alkaloid derived from cacti with hallucinogenic properties. Unlike synthetic drugs such as LSD, which are produced in labs, cocaine and mescaline can be easily and cheaply extracted in large quantities from cultivated plants, provided they’re of decent quality. 

Indeed, due to its simplicity, mescaline is a popular drug in the desert surrounding **The Scrapyard**, where cacti containing it grow abundantly. However, inside **The Scrapyard**, where much stronger and more addictive synthetic drugs are in fashion, mescaline’s only real use is in cheap mystic cults, where it’s given to believers.

Its effects are simple, short-lived, and require large amounts to be inhaled, making it a primitive and labor-intensive drug. In **The Scrapyard**, the only people still hooked on this stuff were either from remote villages or factory workers from rural backgrounds, far from the heart of the city.
