The manâ€™s frantic escape through countless alleyways abruptly came to an end at a dead-end. Stopped by the sewage river flowing deeply along its edge, the alley ended there. At the end of the alley, it was as if the space ahead was closed off by darkness, trapping him. Leaning his back against it, the man trembled violently as he stared at the alley. From a split or two in his skin, his peach-colored flesh was exposed, but it quickly became hidden by the blood that gushed out.

"Heh, stop it, stop it already!"

With a desperate expression, the man switched the machete he was holding to a reverse grip and slashed his own bare right arm. The searing pain in his arm caused his breathing to become erratic, his chest rising and falling heavily like a bellows. However, as the pain overwhelmed his consciousness, the distorted vision he had regained its clarity. As the hallucinations faded, the man let out a twisted, strained laugh.
