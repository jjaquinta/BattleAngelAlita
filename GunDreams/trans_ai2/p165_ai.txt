Norinco stepped out of the basement and felt something cold gently fall on his forehead. "Oh, snow... when did it start?" The pure white crystals born from the darkness softly made a faint *sff* sound as they began to accumulate on the dimly lit street. "I'm coming home, darling..." Leaving footprints in the snow, Norinco hurried down the street and disappeared into the night.

His childâ€”had they been born yet?

In a rundown apartment tucked away in a back alley, far from the main streets, was Norinco's home. "Has the baby been born, Belchere? Is our child here yet?" Bursting into the room with an armful of bounty heads, Norinco eagerly asked the woman lying on the bed.

"No, not yet, dear. But it will be soon. This little one keeps kicking, eager to meet their father."
