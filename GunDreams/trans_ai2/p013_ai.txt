The man’s desperate escape through countless alleys finally ended at a dead end. He was stopped by a deep, filthy sewer river, and the alley abruptly came to a halt there. Leaning his back against a wire mesh fence built along the bank of the sewer, he trembled as he looked down the alley. The far end of the alley he had just run through was swallowed by darkness, as if cut off by another dimension, making it invisible.

The towering walls on all sides seemed to press down on him, as if ready to crush him. "No! Stop! Stop it!" he screamed with a face contorted in desperation. He switched the old knife he was holding to his right hand and slashed at his own arm. Once, twice—the skin split open, revealing pink flesh, which was quickly covered by the blood that spurted out.

"Agh! No! Ahh!" The intense pain in his arm made his breathing erratic, his chest rising and falling like a bellows. But as the pain overwhelmed his consciousness, the man’s blurred vision rapidly began to regain clarity. As his hallucinations faded and his awareness returned, he let out a twisted, guttural laugh. And then, he stared into the emptiness ahead.
