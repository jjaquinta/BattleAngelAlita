"Out at this hour, huh? Sorry for being such villains," said a voice as Gally and Kyariko approached the entrance to the pleasure district from a dark street. Suddenly, around ten men appeared, surrounding them from the front and back. Each of the ten men held different weapons, their bodies partially modified with cybernetics. Not a single one looked like an upstanding citizen.

"Hey, what's the meaning of this?" Kyariko flicked her spent cigarette onto the ground and asked. A large, fully-cyberized man stepped forward from among the group of thugs.

"Remember me, baby?" His steel bull-like face gleamed in the darkness.

"You’re that guy… Colt, right?" Gally said, recognizing him. The bull-headed Colt snorted and nodded arrogantly.

"Of course you couldn’t forget me, baby. Just like I never forgot about you."
