"Then why are you still alive?" Gally asked Norinco, who was pulling the cart. He gave a crooked smile.

"Fushushuu... Of course, Breda. I live only to raise you," he replied. Norinco had neither the strength nor the meaning to live for himself anymore. He considered himself nothing more than a lump of flesh. Even so, the only reason he continued to live was for Breda's sake alone.

"I exist only as a body for Breda. It's strange that I even have a consciousness at all. Fushushuu... After all, I died when I lost my sight," Norinco said, recounting his sorrowful past to Gally. He explained how he had lost his body in an accident and, even then, became a bounty hunter to provide for the expensive fertility treatments necessary to have a child. He eventually arranged for a woman named Belchea to undergo the procedure, and she became pregnant. But near the time of birth, due to his negligence, both the woman and the unborn child were burned alive. Consumed by guilt, Norinco had gouged out his own eyes.

Gally could understand the depth of his pain and regret up until that point, but what followed after became difficult for her to comprehend.
