In an instant, a red light raced upward from beneath the shadow. Its brilliance traced an arc from the ground to the sky like a crimson banner before melting into the darkness. Almost simultaneously with the crimson banner of light streaking through the darkness, a high-pitched, clear "ping" echoed, shaking the walls of the dark alley.

"W-what...?" The man felt a sense of unease at the absence of the thrill that should have surged when he plunged his blade into the enemy's skull. The resistance of the knife, which should have been felt with the centrifugal force, had vanished somewhere just before touching the shadow's head, leaving him swinging his left arm downward to the ground as if striking nothing but air.

Pulled by the momentum of his swing, the man somersaulted in midair and landed on his back on the pavement, rolling over.

"Ahhh! M-my hand!"

It was when he landed on his back and, due to the pain, reached behind with his left arm that he finally noticed the sense of loss and let out a scream. His left mechanical arm had been severed at the wrist during that brief encounter with the shadow. The wrist of his mechanical arm displayed a sharp cut surface, emitting heat and faint wisps of smoke.

The shadow stood before his eyes as if nothing had happened.
