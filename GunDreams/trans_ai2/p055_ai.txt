It was a sleepless city. Sex, violence, drugs, and fraud were all commonplace here, freely rampant without regulation. Homeless people huddled around burning oil drums for warmth, while others sprawled across the street, staring blankly at the monitors as though their souls had been sucked out. The screens displayed cybernetic fighters in intense combat, and excited onlookers started placing bets on the sidewalk. 

Nearby, a prostitute who had been laughing suddenly went into a bad trip from a cocktail of drugs, screaming in agony. As she collapsed, foaming at the mouth, a group of men in white coats, looking like doctors, appeared from nowhere, swiftly gathering her up and carrying her off somewhere. A fellow prostitute who had witnessed the whole thing simply shrugged and did nothing.

People in the streets, seeing all this unfold, either laughed or cried at their own whims, without a care in the world, passing by without concern.

"This is too much for me..." Gally felt dizzy from the overwhelming sensory overload of bright colors and stimulation in the pleasure district. She felt as though if she stayed any longer, she might pass out from the sheer intensity.
