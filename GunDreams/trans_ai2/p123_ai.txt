Calico remained silent, trying to gauge the old man's intentions, calming the storm within her. The old man, wheezing and cackling, continued, "Well then, let's see what youâ€™ve got, eh?" 

Calico exuded a menacing aura, like a coiled serpent ready to strike, while the fierce rain poured between the narrow gaps of the surrounding buildings. Calico and the old man, who had introduced himself as Norinco, clashed like two writhing serpents, their bodies moving with deadly precision as they splashed through the pooling water beneath them. Thunder cracked as Calico's elegant kicks lit up the scene, revealing Norinco's cunning evasive maneuvers in the flashes of lightning.

"How long are you going to keep playing around, huh? Weren't you supposed to finish me off?" Calico taunted, her voice filled with deadly intent.
