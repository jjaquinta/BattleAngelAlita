Ido lifted the hammer's head, gaining acceleration and centrifugal force, and then mercilessly swung it, driving the sharp end into the woman's temple.

"Oh, Ido really is the serial killer after all..." Gally muttered to herself, trembling at the realization, unable to take her eyes off the gruesome truth unfolding before her.

Below Gally, Ido gazed at the woman’s head, still stuck to the end of his hammer. The impact had shattered her skull, flattening it like dough, so much so that it was unrecognizable as a human head. Ido faintly smiled, pressed his foot on it, and pulled the head off the hammer’s tip. He then placed the crushed head into the bag he had with him.

“Kukuku, are you shocked?” The red-haired woman crouched down next to Gally and whispered in her ear. Gally just sat there, dazed and numb. Seeing this, the red-haired woman beamed with a wide grin, but when Gally didn’t respond any further, she let out a sigh.

"Oh dear, it looks like she’s completely out of it now. Maybe we overdid it, huh?"
