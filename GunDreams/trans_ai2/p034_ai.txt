In order to return to The Scrapyard, the city of those who live off the scraps of the previous century. Ido Daisuke's cybernetic clinic, located in The Scrapyard, was in a relatively quiet residential area in the east part of the city, on Tempest Street, inside a mixed-use building. By the time Ido finally arrived in front of his home, the sun had already set, and night had fallen. Still holding the girl’s body, Ido hurried straight to the operating room.

As he walked through the room, which was filled with the mechanical chill of clinical sterility, the machines came to life, almost as if by magic, one after another, lighting up their lamps. The multicolored lights reflected off the dim ceiling’s pipes, creating a complex sheen that resembled the texture of some glistening internal organ. 

The half-destroyed girl lay fixed on the operating table, covered in countless cables of various lengths and thicknesses. Surrounded by monitors displaying different waveforms, the girl’s figure, bathed in their glow, resembled a doll imprisoned by mechanical tentacles. 

Ido, doing his best to calm his pounding heart, alternated between looking at the scan images of the girl's head and the data, trying to understand what they meant.
