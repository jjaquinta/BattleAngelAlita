"Don't think you can hunt me so easily," the man said as he wiped his blood-soaked right arm, lowered his stance, and readied his knife. Perhaps because he had survived countless battlefields, his posture was well-practiced and showed no significant openings.

At the man's stance, the shadow let out a sigh and whispered in a low voice.

"A serial killer who only targets women would fetch a slightly better bounty, but well, you'll do for today."

"Haah!" With a shout, the man sharply kicked off the ground. From a leap that seemed impossible for a mere human—like that of a mountain monkey—the man swung his knife straight down onto the shadow's head. His mechanical left arm unleashed immense power, and the accelerated tip of the knife sliced through the air, emitting a sound like a whistle.

It was the one-hit kill technique that had sent many victims and pursuers to their graves.

Just as the man's deadly blade was about to touch the shadow's head, a sharp glint flashed in the shadow's eyes, reflecting the dull light of the knife's blade.
