Norinco held the Breda doll tightly as she ran, exceeding the limits of her thin, worn-out cyborg legs with an abnormal speed.  
"Ah, Norinco-san!"  
Gally stood frozen for a moment, shocked by Norinco's reaction, which was beyond her imagination. She didn’t want to know the truth. Perhaps it was better not to know the truth. Knowing the truth doesn’t necessarily bring happiness, does it? Gally genuinely believed this, but the strange, bitter aftertaste left a knot in her chest, making her feel uneasy.  

"Damn, where did she go?"  
Gally sprinted through the alleyways, chasing after the fleeing Norinco. She had already lost sight of the old woman. Even though Gally didn’t know what she would do once she caught up to Norinco, she just wanted to find the wounded old woman, no matter what.  

Am I wrong? Is it really okay to believe in something that isn't there, or to stay silent and ignore falsehoods?
