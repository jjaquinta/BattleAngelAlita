Gally asked the woman, but she didn't answer and instead led Gally by the hand into a narrow alley.
This was the back side of the pleasure district, a shabby alley full of trash without any streetlights. "Looks like they won’t find us for a while," the woman said. "I’m Shig."
"Um, who are you, ma’am?"
Gally hesitated for a moment and then stopped. A soft voice spoke to her. When Gally turned around, a plump woman stood smiling.
"Well, for now, it’s just a rundown place full of prostitutes, but what about you?"
Shig seemed to have been watching Gally the whole time while she was being hassled. That bull-headed man, Colt, was apparently the leader of a gang of thugs in the area, known for causing trouble. He wasn’t officially a wanted man, but rumors said he had killed a few people behind the scenes.
