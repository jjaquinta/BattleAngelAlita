The moonlight, which had been blocked by the snow, faintly illuminated the alley. The man's face became clear in the dimness. It was Ido Daisuke.
Ido knelt down and opened the trunk calmly. Inside was a disassembled war hammer, which he took out. The head of the hammer was sharply pointed, and the assembled handle was about one and a half meters long. This hammer was not a tool for striking pillows. It was a weapon, called a war hammer, designed to destroy enemies.
Ido, without saying a word, held it with both hands and leaned against the wall, holding his breath.
— One minute... Two minutes...
Ido waited, blending into the shadows of the alley. After a while, figures began to emerge from the depths of the alley, walking toward him.
"Heh... they've come," Ido murmured, his lips curling into a fearless smile. The only white object on him, his gloved hand, tightened around the hammer’s grip with a soft squeak. Finally, the figures approached the crossroads where Ido waited.
