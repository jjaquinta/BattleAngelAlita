Narrowing her deep, cow-like eyes and smiling, Kyariko stood up and spoke to Shig. “Shig, listen. From the time I leave the Factory and return to the entertainment district, it’ll take me about an hour round trip. Until I get back, make sure our buddies hiding in these dirty back alleys take a break, okay? Oh, and…”

Kyariko leaned in and whispered a couple of things into Shig's ear.

“Got it, Kyariko. If those murderers know you’re not around, they probably won’t cause too much trouble,” Shig said with a shiver, flashing her chubby, fox-like smile as she hugged Gally close. 

“Gally, when you become a Hunter, come back here. I’ll introduce you to all my Hunter friends. That way, you won’t be in danger, right? So make sure to come see me again, okay?”

Gally, slightly cringing at Shig’s heavy makeup, hesitated for a moment but then wrapped her arms around Shig’s back. “Thank you for everything, Shig,” she said softly.
