"Is this... me?"

When Ido brought over the mirror he had taken from the sink and showed Gally her reflection, Gally opened her large black eyes wide and expressed honest surprise. The skin tissue on her face, which had been repaired to look like that of a living girl, had been replaced with new, smooth artificial skin.

"Thank you, Ido."

Ido bashfully scratched his head in response to Gally's words and said, "Well, your body isn't fully put together yet."

Gally smiled lightly at Ido's words. Although her head had been completely restored, her torso and external body were still incomplete.
