Norinco closed in on Gally with a strange, serpentine movement, his sharp hand strikes grazing her and steadily wearing away the outer layer of her combat body. He maintained a close distance, never allowing her an opening, like a coiled spring ready to strike.

"Breda wanted to be born. Even in this world where worthless flesh rots away, she would have wanted to come into existence and accomplish something. That's why I send her friends to the afterlife, so Breda won't feel lonely anymore," Norinco said with a mad intensity.

Gally desperately searched for an opening, all while parrying his relentless attacks. But Norincoâ€™s left arm, which extended and contracted at will, combined with his rapid strikes from the right hand, made it nearly impossible for her to counter.

"Ugh, I can't allow you to take the lives of real people just for a phantom!" Gally gritted her teeth as she quickly spun around, attempting to sweep Norinco's legs. But the old man lightly leapt into the air, avoiding her move with ease. Still, she anticipated his reaction.
