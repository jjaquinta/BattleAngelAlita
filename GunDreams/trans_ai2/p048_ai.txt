Waste was being dumped continuously. "Ah, it’s already past noon," Ido muttered as a distant rumble and vibration reached the street where he stood. The waste spewing from Zalem accumulated on the surface, forming a massive slag heap over a thousand meters high at the center of The Scrapyard. When new waste crashed onto the peak of that heap, the impact caused tremors and the distant rumbling sound.

In The Scrapyard, this periodic sound of waste falling from Zalem was used as a kind of time marker. The distant rumble near noon became a signal for ending work early, a practice known as "half-day." Ido, knowing this custom, used the rumble to estimate the time.

"Hey, Gally, come over here," Ido called out. Gally, sitting in a wheelchair, gave him a slightly anxious look. She appeared completely transformed now. Her machine limbs were fully equipped, and her body’s exterior had been repaired with a youthful, feminine silhouette.

It had only been a few days since Ido had obtained the parts for Gally’s legs, and that morning had been spent attaching them.
