Her face was intact. Her closed eyes weren’t especially narrow, but rather large, with a well-defined nose. Her mouth was small, but her lips were thick and full, both the upper and lower lips giving a very striking impression. She must have been a lovely girl.

Ido let out a small smile, thinking how fortunate it was that her head had remained undamaged. He gently touched the girl’s cheek, where small, rubber-like cracks ran across the surface. However, beyond that, there were no apparent functional issues. The technology that had crafted her face, and then transferred to her body, dated back hundreds of years. The synthetic skin had weathered and deteriorated to the point where it felt like aged rubber when pressed.

As a cyber-doctor, Ido’s heart began to race. The traces of advanced cybernetic technology were evident in various places on her body. Yet, despite the expected deterioration, the critical parts of her body weren’t fatally damaged. It was as though the girl had merely fallen asleep, her expression so peaceful, like nothing had happened at all.
