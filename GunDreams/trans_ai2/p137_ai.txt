Though Gally had fought, she remembered very little about the actual battle or its progress. The only thing that stayed with her was the lingering memory of the technique she used. Every time she ventured into the night alone, she would test her strength on streetlights or other objects in deserted streets.

“Gally, don’t go hunting any bounty heads that you don’t recognize. You’re still an inexperienced Hunter, after all,” Ido had sternly told her. For a while, he had made it clear that he wouldn’t let her take on any Hunter jobs unless he was with her. Even now, Ido wasn’t entirely happy with Gally becoming a Hunter-Warrior. He worried that she might get seriously injured again, or that she would become disillusioned with the city’s crime and moral decay. He feared she might grow violent or pick up bad habits. His main concern was his deep care for Gally, who had become a vital member of his family. 

As a result, Ido had recently started sighing every time he saw Gally, though she, seemingly unaware, remained carefree. “I’m much stronger than Ido thinks. He doesn’t trust me enough,” Gally muttered to herself, leaning against a streetlamp that illuminated the night streets. She puffed up her thick lips in slight frustration.
