Sig walked quietly along the deserted nighttime street. Visiting Ido Daisuke's clinic with a message from Calico, Sig had informed him that Gally had become a Hunter and was now left in the pleasure district with Calico.

"I have preparations to make. You may return now," Ido said only that to Sig and closed the door. Sig shrugged at Ido's rude and arrogant attitude, but since Calico hadn't asked her to guide him, she decided to return alone to the pleasure district.

Sig passed through Tempest Street and entered an alleywayâ€”a shortcut leading to the pleasure district. She entered a narrow alley about one meter wide that twisted and turned in complex ways. Although there were no streetlights and it was maze-like, if you knew the way, you could reach the front of the pleasure district in about five minutes. Choosing the main roads would take twice as long.

As Sig was jogging through the narrow alley, a sound like something being rubbed together echoed along the grimy walls from somewhere.
