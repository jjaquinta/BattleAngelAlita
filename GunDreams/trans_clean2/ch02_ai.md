### Chapter 2

The outskirts of **The Scrapyard** were a desolate expanse, ringed by mountains of discarded waste accumulated over centuries. Rusted remnants of the previous era piled high, forming a jagged ridge that scarred the horizon. At first glance, it was a dead world—a graveyard of obsolete machines and forgotten dreams. Yet, to those who knew its secrets, it was a treasure trove of resources waiting to be unearthed.

Bathed in the crimson glow of a setting sun that bled into the horizon, a half-buried girl lay amidst the heaps of scrap. She had been entombed there for centuries, her form recently unearthed by the relentless excavation of heavy machinery. In the deepest layers of the waste, she had slumbered—a state of functional shutdown, a kind of death. The consciousness that once animated her had long since drifted into the void, and her body—a marvel of steel and ceramic—had weathered the passage of time.

"Aah... Ahhh... Wow!"

When Ido Daisuke spotted the girl among the mountains of scrap, he slipped in his excitement, tumbling several meters down the rusted slope. There, amidst the detritus, an angel of machines lay dormant. The thrill of discovering something valuable among the junk electrified him. With the gleam of a child who'd found hidden treasure, Ido scrambled back up the gentle incline, crouching beside the rust-covered figure.

She appeared to be about fifteen or sixteen years old. Though her hair had long since vanished, her soft, egg-shaped face remained remarkably intact. Her closed eyes were large and framed by delicate lashes. A small, straight nose and full, plump lips completed the visage of a girl who must have once been beautiful. It was astonishing that her head had remained undamaged after all this time.

Ido's fingers brushed gently against her cheek. The synthetic skin, aged and weathered, cracked slightly under his touch like worn rubber. His heart raced as he imagined the advanced cyborg technology that might be hidden within her—artifacts from an era far more sophisticated than the regressed techniques of the present.

But as he examined her further, his excitement waned. When he dug out more of her from the scrap, it became clear that, aside from her peaceful, sleeping expression, the rest of her body was critically damaged. Her arms and legs were missing, her torso below the chest severely compromised. Most of her artificial organs and neural systems were destroyed. The remains of her spine were severed; there was nothing functional left.

"She's just old junk now," Ido muttered, a hint of sorrow in his voice.

He sighed and stood, turning his back on her. If only he'd found her a hundred years earlier. Yet, as he began to descend the slope, a nagging reluctance tugged at him. He looked back. The girl lay abandoned atop the heap, bathed in the fiery glow of the dying sun.

Why does she feel so... alive?

Among countless cyborg remnants, this girl alone seemed vivid, as if merely sleeping. An illogical thought sparked in Ido's mind—was she truly dead? He tried to dismiss the notion, reminding himself of the evidence before him.

"Heart and lungs stopped functioning long ago. Liver is missing. Generator's gone. The emergency battery is half-destroyed. There's nothing left working inside her. The only part I haven't checked is... her brain."

The idea was absurd. A brain couldn't survive hundreds of years without preservation. Yet, a stubborn curiosity compelled him. He found himself crouching beside her once more.

"I'm about to do something pointless," he chuckled bitterly.

Gently, he lifted her lifeless head, cradling it in his hands. With his expertise as a cybernetic physician, he knew how to detect any signs of residual function. He carefully tilted her head, listening, feeling.

Wait.

Her head felt unexpectedly heavy, the center of gravity unshifting, like a hard-boiled egg. Could it be? Was there a chance her brain was intact?

"No... this can't be..."

A surge of excitement coursed through him.

"Even something absurd is worth believing in when you have a hunch!"

Someone had preserved her brain, possibly through a unique method he hadn't yet comprehended. It was unprecedented, but the possibility ignited a spark of hope.

"I'll take her to my clinic. It's worth a shot."

With renewed determination, Ido hurried away from the scrapyard, stars beginning to prick the twilight sky. He carried the girl carefully, making his way back to his home where the necessary equipment awaited.

---

Ido's cybernetic clinic was nestled in a relatively quiet residential area on Tempest Street, in the eastern part of **The Scrapyard**. By the time he arrived, night had fully fallen. Without delay, he brought the girl into the operating room.

As he entered, the sterile machines hummed to life, sensors activating, monitors flickering. The room filled with a mechanical glow, casting intricate patterns of light that danced like reflections off polished metal.

He laid the girl's damaged body on the operating table, connecting her to an array of cables and diagnostic equipment. The monitors displayed a cascade of data, illuminating her form in a ghostly halo.

Ido's heart pounded as he scanned the images of her head, analyzing the readings. As he delved deeper into the data, astonishment spread across his face.

"I can't believe a preservation method like this exists," he whispered.

Her brain had been plastinated—preserved in a state of suspended animation. Though its functions had ceased, the structure remained intact, untouched by decay even after centuries.

Who had done this? And why?

Questions swirled in his mind, but he set them aside. The immediate task was clear.

"Can I successfully revive her?"

He recalled a clinical report he'd once read—a procedure for reversing plastination and restoring brain function. It was a rare and risky process, but if it worked...

"It's worth trying."

He touched the emblem on his forehead—a circle with a squared-off top—a symbol from his distant past. With a deep breath, he began the delicate operation.

---

A full day passed. Ido hadn't rested, his focus unwavering. The clinic remained closed, the outside world forgotten.

Dressed in a rumpled white coat, he sat beside the sleeping girl, monitoring her vitals. Waveforms danced across the screens, reflected in his round glasses. He waited, hoping for a sign.

The door creaked open.

"Hey, Ido! What's got you so worked up this time?"

A man over fifty swaggered in, shaking his large belly and holding a bottle of liquor. It was Gonzu, one of the few friends Ido had. A fully human man except for an iron plate on his head, Gonzu filled the room with the pungent scent of alcohol.

Ido wrinkled his nose but didn't turn around. "Look at this, Gonzu. It's amazing."

Gonzu staggered over, squinting at the girl on the table. "Just some old junk, isn't it? You've picked up more scrap?"

"She's not junk. She's... alive," Ido said, showing him the monitor.

Gonzu's eyes widened. "Wait, you're telling me this heap is functional?"

Ido nodded, a satisfied grin spreading across his face. "Her brain was preserved. I've managed to bring it back to life."

Gonzu shook his head, bewildered. "You're into some weird stuff, Ido."

He took a swig from his bottle. "What are you going to do, waking up a girl in this bleak world? Seems like a waste of time."

Ido smiled softly, his gaze fixed on the girl. "Perhaps. But maybe she deserves another chance."

---

Three days later, around 7 PM, the girl stirred.

"Ido! I think she's waking up," Gonzu said, nudging him awake.

Ido's eyes snapped open. He leaned forward, watching intently as her eyelids fluttered.

Slowly, she opened her eyes.

"Hey," Ido said gently. "I'm Ido Daisuke. What's your name?"

"N... name?" she murmured, her gaze distant and unfocused.

She didn't remember. Her memory was a blank slate. Ido wasn't surprised.

"That's okay. You'll remember in time," he reassured her. "From today, your name will be Gally."

She looked at him, a faint smile forming on her lips. "Gally..."

She accepted the name without hesitation, a newfound identity in a world she didn't recognize.

---

Five days passed.

"Is this... me?" Gally asked, her large eyes wide with wonder.

Ido held up a mirror, reflecting her restored face. Her black hair framed her features, and the synthetic skin had been repaired to perfection. She looked like any ordinary girl.

"Thank you, Ido," she said softly.

He scratched his head, a bit flustered. "It's nothing. We still need to get you a proper body."

She glanced down. Her head and neck were complete, but her torso and limbs were still incomplete. Though he had restored her internal systems—artificial organs, spine, generator—he hadn't yet found suitable limbs or a body frame.

"Can you hold on a little longer?" he asked gently. "I'll find arms and legs that fit you soon, I promise."

She smiled. "I trust you."

---

Night enveloped **The Scrapyard**, the silver moon peeking through scattered clouds. Ido, dressed in black, walked alone through a dimly lit alley, carrying a metallic trunk. His footsteps echoed faintly.

He chose the narrow, unlit streets, moving with purpose. Suddenly, he stopped at a crossroads. The moonlight illuminated his face as he knelt and opened the trunk, assembling a war hammer with practiced ease. The weapon was formidable—a sharp-pointed head atop a one-and-a-half-meter handle.

Ido gripped the hammer tightly, pressing himself against the wall. Minutes passed as he waited in silence.

Footsteps approached.

"They're here," he whispered, a defiant grin tugging at his lips.

Two figures emerged—a pair of women walking together. Ido reached into his pocket, retrieving a single round chip. With a flick, he sent it rolling down the alley.

The chip glinted in the moonlight, catching the attention of the women.

"Agh!"

"Kyaa!"

One of them darted forward, reaching for the chip like a predator pouncing on prey.

Now.

Ido sprang from the shadows, unleashing all his stored energy. He moved with lethal precision, swinging the hammer in a devastating arc.

"Uooooahhh!"

The sharp tip of the hammer struck the crouching woman, piercing her skull. Sparks flew as she collapsed, her body crumpling lifelessly.

The second woman gasped, eyes wide with horror. Rage twisted her features as she glared at Ido.

He raised the hammer again, bringing it down with crushing force. She barely evaded the blow, sacrificing her left arm, which was severed and fell to the ground.

Blood spattered as she turned and fled into the darkness, her screams fading into the night.

Ido exhaled slowly, surveying the scene. Bloodstains marked the pavement like morbid flowers.

"One of them got away," he muttered, adjusting the brim of his black leather hat.

---

He stood alone in the silent alley, the weight of his actions settling upon him. The wind whispered through the narrow streets, carrying with it the distant sounds of the city.

Ido retrieved a cloth from his coat and wiped the blood from his hammer. His expression was unreadable—a mix of determination and something darker.

He glanced once more at the lifeless body, then turned and vanished into the shadows.

---

Back at the clinic, Gally dreamed peacefully, unaware of the night's events. The gentle hum of the machines lulled her into a deep sleep.

Ido returned quietly, setting the trunk aside. He looked at her serene face, a softness touching his eyes.

"Rest well, Gally," he whispered.

He sat beside her, the weight of his double life heavy on his shoulders. The protector and the predator, two halves of the same man.

For now, he would focus on giving her a new beginning.

---

The night deepened, stars glimmering like distant beacons. In the heart of **The Scrapyard**, amid the decay and desolation, a spark of hope flickered.

And so, the story began anew.
