A loud cracking sound echoed, and the man flailed his limbs like an insect, screaming.

"Yes... yes! I love that sound of bones."

Enjoying the sensation of crushed bones, the woman repeatedly stomped on the man's back, licking the corner of her lips—shaped into a cruel smile—with her blood-colored tongue.

As the light in her eyes sparkled behind her glasses, she spoke to the man, whose bravado had completely vanished and who now trembled in mere fear of pain and death.

"Never thought I'd have to use a cartridge on someone like you, worth just 90,050 chips. These things are expensive, you know?"

Lifting the hem of her worn-out coat, the woman pointed to the leg she was using to step on the man.

On the shin of that mechanical leg, which had lost any human form, there was a bolt-like handle reminiscent of those seen on firearms and a semi-cylindrical shutter resembling an ejection port.

With a heavy clanking sound, the woman pulled the bolt, causing the shutter to slide open and eject a cylindrical cartridge from inside.

"It's equipped with a heat-ray blade—an electric heating system built into my shin, like a Bowie knife. That's what it is."
