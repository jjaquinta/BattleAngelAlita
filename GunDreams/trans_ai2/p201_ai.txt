Gally used the momentum from her leg sweep to roll backward onto her hands, executing a spinning upward kick with outstretched legs as she inverted her body. Norinco, still airborne, couldn't evade her kick completely and tumbled to the ground. However, the damage wasn't critical, and the old man quickly regained his footing. Gally clicked her tongue in frustration at the failed strike.

"Sly little girl, using such a tricky move there. But that won’t work again on the Mantis Norinco," he sneered as he crouched into his peculiar stance once more and slithered toward her.

Gally tried to anticipate his movements, shifting her stance to counter, but Norinco's approach was like being trapped in a web—no matter how she moved, he closed in. His coiling left arm wrapped around her limbs, constricting her movements. The old man then struck with his right hand, delivering precise blows to her arms and legs.

Each attack wasn't particularly strong by itself, but gradually, he peeled away the outer layers of her cybernetic body, exposing the actuators and mechanical components beneath. A chilling sense of dread began to creep over her as she realized the systematic dismantling of her defenses.
