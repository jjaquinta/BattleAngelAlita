Aside from occasionally adjusting the equipment, Ido stared intently at the monitor. The parabolic curves of multiple waveforms were reflected in the lenses of his round glasses, with light flowing gently across the screen. If the thawing process went smoothly, she should be waking up soon...

Ido exhaled the breath he'd been holding in his lungs, just as the door to the operating room creaked open with a dull sound.

"Hey, what are you so wrapped up in this time, Ido?"

A middle-aged man, over fifty years old, with a large belly jiggling as he walked, barged in without hesitation, a bottle of alcohol in one hand. The man, named Gonzo, was one of the few people Ido considered a friend. Gonzo, except for the riveted manhole cover-like metal plate fixed to his head, was otherwise fully human. As Gonzo entered the room, the smell of alcohol instantly wafted through the air. Ido wrinkled his nose slightly at the smell but didn’t turn around, continuing to type on the keyboard connected to the monitor as he murmured:

"Hey, Gonzo... Take a look at this. She’s amazing."

"What is it? Just some old kid’s junk, isn’t it? What have you gone and picked up this time?"
