It was a pineapple-headed woman.

"...A woman?"

"Hmph, well, sort of."

With a twisted smirk on her red lips, the pursuer who was stepping on the man said, "I don’t have much of a mind or chromosomes left."

Indeed, her face and body shape were that of a woman. However, what peeked out from the rumpled brown coat draped over her was a body entirely made of steel and ceramic — an artificial body. Apart from the skin on her face and her brain, she had fully mechanized her entire body, making her a full-body cyborg.

The full-body cyborg woman crouched down, resting her elbow on her knee while stepping on the man, and flashed a sarcastic sneer at his pathetic figure.

"The hunter who blew away my wrist with a kick is a full-body cyborg woman, huh? What a fanatic sister."

The man desperately twisted his neck, spitting out the words as if trying to seem tough. In response to the man's cheeky attitude, the woman pressed harder with the foot she had planted on his back without even lifting it.
