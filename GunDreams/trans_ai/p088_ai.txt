Gally trembled slightly at Kyariko's words and lowered her head in silence. After a while, she raised her face and pleaded with Kyariko.

"Ido is against me becoming a Hunter, but... this is my decision. It's true that if it weren't for Ido, I wouldn't be alive right now. But since I am alive, I need to find proof of thatâ€”for myself. I want to do something that helps me find that meaning. I want to become a Hunter-Warrior!" 

When Gally finished speaking, she clamped her mouth shut again, as if sealing her words, and lowered her head. Her hands were clenched tightly, and her shoulders trembled slightly. 

With a soft sigh, Kyariko placed a hand on Gally's shoulder. "Lift your head, Gally. You look like a scolded child, hanging your head like that. Really, if you're that determined to pursue your own path with such purity, that's admirable. Fine, I'll show you how to register as a Hunter. Okay?"

"Really, Kyariko...?" Gally asked, her voice trembling with hope.
