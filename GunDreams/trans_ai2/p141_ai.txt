Several women, terrified, screamed as they rushed out into the street, one after another. One woman had a deep cut across her back and collapsed from blood loss before she could reach the crowded street. Gally, standing at the entrance of the bar, quietly closed the door behind her with a soft "click" that somehow sounded louder than the faint melody of the old record playing inside the dimly lit bar.

There wasn't a single intact table or chair in the room—most had been smashed or toppled over, lying in pieces on the floor. Among the wreckage were the lifeless bodies of several unlucky patrons who hadn’t managed to escape in time.
