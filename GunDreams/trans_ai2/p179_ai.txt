"Yeah. I can handle things better than you think, Ido," Gally said firmly before dashing out of the house. Left behind, Ido trembled, his repressed emotions toward her finally erupting. "Damn it, damn it! She's mine! Mine!" Ido, overcome with rage, spent three days tearing apart the room in a fit of anger.

After leaving the house, Gally stopped by Bergman's shop to pick up a combat body that had been customized for her. "The design's a bit old-fashioned, but the horsepower is double that of the Cyprian model. The outer shell is made of special self-locking armor, so no ordinary blade can get through. Renting this bad boy for a week costs 30,000 chipsâ€”pretty reasonable, eh? What do you think, missy?" Bergman grinned widely as Gally nervously lay down on the operating table, unsure of what was to come.

"Uh, Bergman... are you sure you can really switch my body properly?"
