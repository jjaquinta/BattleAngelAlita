CHAPTER 1

“Kihee!” The man was running frantically through the moonlit night. There were no streetlights in the dimly lit alleys. Sparks from torn and hanging cables on the crumbling walls illuminated the darkness with a pale blue light. The man’s wild figure dashed through the flickering light and shadow, appearing and disappearing like an animation. He was a half-cyborg with part of his head and his left arm mechanized. In his machine arm, he gripped a large, old machete, its faintly gleaming blade stained with thick, dark blood.

This place was a district far removed from the pleasure quarters of **The Scrapyard**, where only grimy alleys, like capillaries, wound through the narrow gaps between buildings, devoid of life.
