"Hah... oh no..." Gally had no escape. Before she knew it, several women, likely Shigu's associates, had emerged from the shadows on both sides of the alley, surrounding her. 

"You’re too kind, aren’t you? I didn’t save you for free, you know. It’s time you accept your fate and behave... hey," Shigu ordered, nodding her chin. 

One of the women pushed Gally against the wall and pressed a knife against her neck. 

"What do you plan to do to me?" Gally demanded, but the women ignored her. Instead, they rolled up her sleeves, inspecting her arms and legs.

"Shigu, no doubt about it. This girl’s arm... it's from the missing Stea."

"And her legs? They’re from that notorious killer."

The women murmured among themselves, all eyes turning to Shigu. Shigu let out a low growl, glaring at Gally with an intense expression that bore none of the warmth or playfulness she had shown before.
