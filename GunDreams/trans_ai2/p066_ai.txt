"No... no, stop it!" Gally's eyes widened as far as they could go. Sig's lips curled into a cruel smile, and without hesitation, she swung the knife down with full force. The cold, sharp tip of the blade came dangerously close to Gally's forehead. Frozen in fear, Gally couldn't tear her eyes away from the sight. Her mind screamed as the terror of death paralyzed her.

"I don't want to die... not yet!" Her thoughts sparked and blurred into a white-hot flash, and in that moment, something inside Gally snapped with a sharp *crack*. 

"Fuuuu... Ooooooh!" Gally's eyes suddenly gleamed with the fierce sharpness of a wild feline, glowing with intense light. As Sig brought down the knife with all her might, Gally reacted with instinctive precision, catching the blade between her fists just before it reached her forehead. 

With a loud *snap*, the knife shattered and scattered into pieces. 

"H-hiiiii!" Sig let out a terrified, shrill cry, shocked by the sudden surge of energy from Gally.
