At the moment Gally's leg brushed against Norincoâ€™s body, a sharp, clear sound rang out into the red sky. In that brief aerial clash, the two passed each other simultaneously and landed. Gally crouched down, while Norinco stood frozen in place. As Gally wobbled in her stance, her damaged left arm detached from the shoulder and fell to the ground with a thud.

"Fuu... shunuu... you... little... brat," Norinco muttered his last words, before collapsing forward. A closer look revealed that his temple was crushed, with brain matter leaking from his ear. In mid-air, Gally had managed to dodge Norinco's hand blade using her advanced aerial control techniques. By hooking her leg onto his body, she spun around him, positioning herself behind him to strike his temple with her elbow.

The name of that move would later become known as **"Angel's Wing Hook"**, a technique that deeply etched itself into Gally's heart.

Gally approached the fallen Norinco, who lay face down, and gently lifted his body.

"Bre... Bredda..." Norinco muttered weakly.
