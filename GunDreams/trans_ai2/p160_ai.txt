"The old man's completely gone in the head. He used to be a skilled Hunter called Norinco, but now he's lost his eyesight and ended up like that," Bergman said.

Gally responded with a simple "Hmm," quickly losing interest in the old man. Her focus was on checking out the Hunter-grade combat cyborg bodies available in Bergman's shop.

"Hey, Bergman, um... What kind of Hunter bodies do you have?" Gally asked, her eyes sparkling with excitement.

Bergman gave her a wink and a thumbs-up, grinning. "You came back the day after already? Don't worry, kid, my stock is the best in the Eastern District. Whatever your budget, I can get you exactly what you need. Come on in."

"Awesome! I wonder if you have a body like Calicoâ€™s? It must be super expensive though," Gally said as the two of them laughed and disappeared into the shop.
