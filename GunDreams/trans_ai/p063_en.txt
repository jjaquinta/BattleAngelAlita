"...Ahh!?"
However, Gally had no escape route. When she looked around, she saw that several women, apparently colleagues of Shig, had emerged from the shadows on both sides of the alley and surrounded her.
"You're too naive. There's no way we'd help for free. Better cooperate... hey!"
At Shig's gesture, one of the women pushed Gally against the wall and pressed a knife to her neck.
"What are you planning to do to me?"
Without answering Gally's question, the women rolled up her sleeves and examined her arms and legs.
"Shig, no doubt about it. This girl's arm... it's the missing Steer's!"
"And her legsâ€”they're from the murdered Walsa..."
The women spoke one after the other, glancing at Shig. With a stern look on her face, which didn't match the once caring expression, Shig glared at Gally.
