At least, for herself, it was something she couldn’t accept. That’s why Gally wanted to tell Norinco the truth as well.

"...So, I ended up here, huh." After running through several alleyways, Gally found herself in a desolate wasteland, far from the structures of the city. She had reached the labyrinth of red ruins in the scrapyard. Looking back towards where she came from, she could just make out the silhouette of the floating city of Zalem, tinted red by the setting sun. This was the very edge of the small world known as The Scrapyard.

As Gally walked through the maze of tangled, decaying remnants of the previous century, she thought about the old man, Norinco. Thinking back on it, it seemed that Norinco had subjected himself to abuse rather than merely being forced into it by being homeless. He lived only to love and raise the imaginary daughter, Breda. When that entire illusion was shattered, he fled in despair, screaming.

"Am I... am I wrong?" Gally wondered. The truth isn’t always something that brings happiness. If that’s the case, would her desire to know her true self, the part of her she had lost, only bring her unhappiness?
