CHAPTER 4

"Hey... come on, wake up already." A voice that had seemed distant now struck Gally's awareness sharply, pulling her back into reality. When she opened her eyes, the red-haired woman, with an unsettling smile, was peering down at her. Gally had been unconscious for five minutes, and during that time, she had lost all sense of her surroundings.

"Where... am I?" Gally murmured. She found herself lying on what appeared to be the rooftop of a building. The red-haired woman had carried her up here.

The woman stood at the edge of the building, where there were no fences or barriers, gazing down below. "Take a look. It's quite something, don’t you think?"

With a quiet chuckle, the red-haired woman motioned with her chin for Gally to look down from the building. Though slightly annoyed at being ordered around, Gally pouted her own thick lips, not wanting to lose to the woman, and peeked over the edge.

“Ah, that’s... Ido...”

About ten meters below, in a small intersection of alleyways, a black figure was lurking. The figure was unmistakably Ido, dressed in his usual black attire, leaning against the shadow of a building that framed the alley. Next to him was the large trunk case that Gally had seen when he had snuck out earlier.

Ido was holding an abnormally large hammer in his arms. The tip of the hammer was sharply pointed—clearly not meant for driving stakes or anything practical.

“What... what is Ido planning to do?” Gally muttered in a mix of suspicion and concern. Just then, faint footsteps echoed from the darkness of the alley. A silhouette, seemingly of a woman, began to emerge toward the alley where Ido was hiding. Ido, of course, remained still, unnoticed.

Noticing the approaching footsteps, Ido pressed his ear against the wall, his body close to the corner. From the alley just to his left, a woman slowly emerged. As Ido silently raised his hammer, Gally began to grasp what was about to happen, and a shiver of realization ran through her.

"No... you can't, Ido!" 

The red-haired woman watching the scene wore a gleeful smile, as if savoring the spectacle before her. 

"A-ah..." 

Just as Gally reached out and began to shout to stop him, Ido's hammer came crashing down, shattering the woman's skull. The sound was eerily similar to crushing an insect underfoot. As the woman reached the crossroads of the alley, Ido swiftly stepped out from the side, cutting in front of her from behind. The woman, startled by the sudden encounter, froze. 

Ido swung his hammer like a pendulum, allowing the force of its momentum to carry him into a spinning motion. And just like a shot put...

As Ido lifted the head of the hammer, using the acceleration and centrifugal force to his advantage, he mercilessly swung the hammer's tip into the woman's temple. "Ah... so Ido *is* the serial killer," Gally muttered, overwhelmed by the brutal reality in front of her, unable to avert her eyes. Below, Ido stood, gazing down at the head of the woman now crushed into the hammer. Her head had been obliterated by the force of the blow, making it impossible to even recognize it as once being human. Ido let out a faint smile, stepping on the flattened remains to pull them free from the hammerhead. Then, he carefully placed the crushed head into a burlap sack he was holding.

"Hehe... shocked, aren't you?" whispered the red-haired woman who had crouched down beside Gally, speaking softly into her ear. Gally sat there, dazed and frozen. Seeing this, the red-haired woman smiled broadly at first, but as Gally remained unresponsive, she sighed. 

"Oh dear... she's completely out of it. Maybe I went a little too far with the fun, huh?"

The red-haired woman shook the dazed Gally and lightly slapped her cheeks. "Come on, snap out of it. That was nothing, you know. It's just a hunter's job," she said. Gradually, the focus returned to Gally's once-vacant eyes. 

"Ido isn't a serial killer; he's a hunter who hunts down serial killers," the red-haired woman explained. Gally fully came to her senses and grabbed the woman's collar. "A hunter? What do you mean? He just killed that woman like that!" 

The red-haired woman began to explain the existence of Hunter-Warriors in The Scrapyard. In The Scrapyard, aside from crimes that concern the Factory or Zalem, everything is handled by the Factory placing bounties on the heads of criminals to maintain order. The bounty hunters who pursue these marked criminals and eliminate them are called Hunter-Warriors in The Scrapyard.

"So, the woman Ido just killed was..."

"Yeah, she was on the list. One of the insane mutant sisters, Asnas."

"She's the youngest of the sisters. Her crimes include multiple murders and assaults. The bounty on her head is a modest 32,000 chips," the red-haired woman said, handing Gally a printout of the bounty list. Gally let out a long sigh of relief after reading it.

"Feeling better now? Ido, well... he's one of the decent ones. He doesn't take on bodyguard gigs like I do. I mean, he only hunts small fry on the side, probably not out of desperation. Still, he's doing alright," the red-haired woman continued.

Gally now understood the truth—that Ido was working as a Hunter-Warrior to earn money to repair her body. The red-haired woman also explained that the body parts were acquired cheaply from corpse recovery dealers.

"Honestly, you were taking everything Shig and the others said so seriously, I couldn't resist messing with you a little," the woman added with a smirk. Her name was Kyariko, another Hunter-Warrior like Ido. She mentioned that she had met Ido once or twice before. Kyariko pulled a crumpled cigarette from her coat pocket and lit it, exhaling purple smoke.

"By the way, girl, you said your name was Gally, right? Where did you learn that technique?" Gally gave a wry smile at Kyariko's question and replied, "I don't really know. I was just brought back to life by Ido. I still don't understand much about myself."

The various martial arts techniques that had surged up from deep within her heart were still sinking back into the fog of her memories, hidden in the depths of her mind. It seemed that her memories would only surface in moments of extreme stress, triggered by specific situations.

"Hey Kyariko, do you think we'll meet again sometime?" Gally asked suddenly. Kyariko scratched her head, letting her gaze drift into the night sky, then flicked her cigarette away. Without looking back at Gally, she disappeared into the direction of the entertainment district.

"Will I make it home before Ido gets back...?" Gally ran through the dark alleys at a quick pace. By the time she returned home from the entertainment district, she was lucky—Ido hadn't returned yet. He likely had to stop by the Factory to cash in the bounty, which is why he was later than Gally.

The next day, Gally felt as if everything that had happened the previous night was a dream. So much had happened, and it was such a whirlwind of changes. When Gally let her guard down, it felt as if her soul had been drained, leaving her in a daze. The brief encounter with Kyariko replayed in her mind.

"What happened, Gally? Your body has dents and scratches all over," Ido said in a concerned tone, tightening the bolts on the maintenance hatch of Gally's body as she lay on the bed.

“There’s no problem with your internal organs, but one of your joints is a little misaligned. Did something happen?”  
“Uh, no, nothing... I just tripped a bit. Sorry, it’s nothing serious,” Gally responded, but her mind was clearly elsewhere. At that moment, her thoughts were consumed by the battle with Kyariko in the entertainment district, replaying like a whirlwind in her head. She longed to experience again the fleeting sense of fulfillment she’d felt in that moment, the strange exhilaration when fragments of her past memories flashed back. Her mind was entirely preoccupied with that.

“Gally, what’s going on? Do you have something on your mind? You’re not keeping secrets, are you?” Ido leaned closer, his expression growing more concerned as he gazed at her. At last, Gally snapped back to herself and forced a smile.  
“Oh, no, it’s nothing. I just have a few things on my mind, that’s all. Don’t worry about it.”  
“...If you say so. Then, alright.”

Ido sensitively picked up on Gally’s awkward attempt to smooth things over, but he decided to let it rest for now. He didn't want to let his emotions get the best of him. However, the feelings he held back found no outlet and sank deep in his gut like sediment. Gally also sensed some tension between herself and Ido, which pained her, but she convinced herself that there was nothing she could do to stop the overwhelming urge that drove her.

That night, Gally finally resolved to confess her troubled thoughts to Ido. Ido, in surprise, slammed the table and stood up.  
“Why... why are you suddenly talking about being a Hunter Warrior? This is nonsense! Gally, how could you ever become a Hunter Warrior?”  
Gally, her cheeks slightly flushed, looked at Ido with a mix of determination and vulnerability.  
“I’ve started to remember... I remember that I used to know the art of combat. And by putting myself in battle, little by little, I can reclaim those skills as my own.”  
Ido shook his head, cutting her off with firm resolve.

"But that's not why I dug you out of the scrapyard," Ido said, turning his back on Gally, ready to leave the room. "You don't understand how ugly and dirty battle really is." 

As Ido walked away, Gally shouted at his retreating figure, "I know, Ido! I know you're a Hunter Warrior! If fighting is so ugly and dirty, why are *you* doing it?" 

Her words struck Ido like the tip of a spear, causing him to flinch. "What? So... you knew, huh? That's how you learned about the Hunter Warriors, Gally... I see." 

Even though Gally was rattled by her own words, she gathered her strength and pleaded with Ido in a trembling voice. "I'm sorry... for following you. But I realized how much danger you put yourself in to restore me. I can't let you face such filthy, dangerous things all by yourself, not just for me!"

Ido, still facing away from Gally, muttered as if to himself. "For your sake, I'd gladly sever any criminal's head. I'd bathe in their blood without hesitation. But... I want you to remain my dream."

"Ido..." Gally felt a tightening pain in her chest, as if her heart were being crushed. In this world, no one cared for her as deeply as Ido did.

"I just want to make you into something more beautiful," Ido continued, turning to face her, his voice strained and anguished. But Gally, like a butterfly slipping through his fingers, left the room.

"I'm sorry, Ido... but I can't be your dress-up doll."

Left alone in the room, Ido wept.

Gally wandered aimlessly through the bustling streets of the pleasure district. Having left Ido, she was lost, unsure of what to do or where to go. Should she really pursue becoming a Hunter Warrior?

Gally didn’t even know how to become a Hunter, leaving her feeling lost. She sat down on a pile of old monitors at the edge of the street and let out a deep sigh. “What should I do now…”

At that moment, someone placed a hand on her shoulder with a soft pat.

“…We meet again,” a voice said.

“Shig?”

When Gally looked up, she saw the plump, tanuki-faced woman, Shig. Scratching her head awkwardly, Shig gave a small bow to Gally.

"Yeah, sorry about yesterday. I had no idea your friend was a Hunter. I found out from Kyariko—what a big mistake, huh?"

As Gally watched the sheepish Shig scratching her head, the once lost and wandering Gally now saw her shining like a beacon. To Gally, Shig appeared as a goddess of salvation. Without thinking, Gally hugged Shig tightly.

“There, there,” Shig said.

The place where Shig took Gally was behind one of The Scrapyard's top pink cabarets, located near the heart of the eastern district's entertainment hub.

“Does Kyariko live in a place like this?” Gally asked, to which Shig chuckled softly and explained.

“They call her 'Kyariko the Vagabond.' That woman doesn’t have a proper home. She works as a bouncer for all kinds of places in the entertainment district, so you could say the entire district is basically her home.”

As they walked down the grimy alley, they reached the back entrance of the cabaret. Gally and Shig entered through the door and made their way down the hallway, arriving at one of the dressing rooms for the strippers.

“Hey, it’s me, Shig!” Shig called out, banging on the door roughly. After a brief pause, there was the sound of the doorknob turning.

“Quit making such a racket. Did you finally catch a lead on the serial killer?”

"Oh my, if it isn't Gally-chan. You shouldn't be coming to a place like this, it's not good for a kid's upbringing," Kyariko said, waving her hand dismissively as if to shoo them away.

"Kyariko, Gally here says she wants to become a Hunter. She came all this way just to ask you," Shig said, wedging her foot in the door as Kyariko tried to retreat back into the room. Kyariko sighed and pulled out a cigarette.

"Kyariko-san, since I woke up, I haven't had anyone to rely on. I really don't know anything—about this town or anything. Even though I want to become a Hunter-Warrior, I just... don’t know where to start," Gally pleaded, her words filled with desperation as Kyariko exhaled smoke with an exasperated look.

"Come on, Kyariko. Don't be mean—just tell Gally how to register as a Hunter. You only need to take her to the Factory, it's not that hard," Shig said, siding with Gally.

Reluctantly, Kyariko scratched her head and released a long sigh, expelling all the air she had held in her lungs.

Gally trembled at Kyariko’s words and lowered her head in silence. After a moment, she looked up and spoke to Kyariko with determination.

“Ido is against me becoming a Hunter, but… this is something I’ve decided for myself. It’s true that if it weren’t for Ido, I wouldn’t be alive right now, but as long as I am alive, I need proof—for myself. I want to do something that helps me find out why I’m alive. I want to become a Hunter-Warrior!”

After she finished speaking, Gally pressed her lips together tightly and lowered her head again, clenching her hands so hard that her shoulders shook slightly. 

Kyariko let out a soft sigh and placed her hand on Gally’s shoulder. 

“Lift your head, Gally. You look like a child being scolded, hanging your head like that. Honestly, if you have such a pure desire to live your life, that’s admirable. Fine, I’ll teach you how to become a Hunter. Okay?”

“Really, Kyariko…?” Gally asked, her voice filled with hope.

Narrowing her deep, cow-like eyes and smiling, Kyariko stood up and spoke to Shig. “Shig, listen. From the time I leave the Factory and return to the entertainment district, it’ll take me about an hour round trip. Until I get back, make sure our buddies hiding in these dirty back alleys take a break, okay? Oh, and…”

Kyariko leaned in and whispered a couple of things into Shig's ear.

“Got it, Kyariko. If those murderers know you’re not around, they probably won’t cause too much trouble,” Shig said with a shiver, flashing her chubby, fox-like smile as she hugged Gally close. 

“Gally, when you become a Hunter, come back here. I’ll introduce you to all my Hunter friends. That way, you won’t be in danger, right? So make sure to come see me again, okay?”

Gally, slightly cringing at Shig’s heavy makeup, hesitated for a moment but then wrapped her arms around Shig’s back. “Thank you for everything, Shig,” she said softly.

“Haha, Gally, really, you shouldn’t be calling an active, single working girl like me ‘Auntie,’” Shig said with a laugh as she turned and quickly disappeared down the alley. Gally and Kyariko watched her go, then left the entertainment district and headed toward the Factory. That was the last time anyone ever saw Shig.

The Factory was the ground management system controlled by the aerial city of Zalem, which maintained and governed The Scrapyard. Initially, the Factory was simply a system necessary for running the ground-level factories that produced goods for Zalem. However, as more people gathered in the city, drawn by factory jobs and the scrap recycling business, the city expanded, and with it, the issues and crimes increased. In response, the Factory's role grew and diversified into a governing body that handled these troubles. Today, it serves as the core of judicial, legislative, and administrative functions for the city.

In the dim night, the Factory loomed faintly under scattered lights. Massive steel pipes coiled and intertwined, converging as the structure towered high. Looking up, one could see a thick, ivory-colored pipe extending from the top of the structure, stretching toward the sky.

The massive structure seemed to stretch upward, as if being drawn into the distant disc floating in the night sky. This building formed the base of the tube connecting to the aerial city of Zalem. From the enormous front gate of the Factory, a lone figure emerged.

"Is it really this easy to become a Hunter Warrior?" Gally puffed out her cheeks, looking unsatisfied as she rubbed her head with both hands. She had been brought to the Factory to register as a Hunter Warrior, but all it took was a laser imprinting an identification code directly onto her brain—there were no other formalities involved.

"Becoming one is easy," Kyariko replied. "But making a name for yourself? That's the hard part. You get that, right?"

"I don't really understand what it means to 'make money' yet..." Gally said, her tone unsure.

"Out at this hour, huh? Sorry for being such villains," said a voice as Gally and Kyariko approached the entrance to the pleasure district from a dark street. Suddenly, around ten men appeared, surrounding them from the front and back. Each of the ten men held different weapons, their bodies partially modified with cybernetics. Not a single one looked like an upstanding citizen.

"Hey, what's the meaning of this?" Kyariko flicked her spent cigarette onto the ground and asked. A large, fully-cyberized man stepped forward from among the group of thugs.

"Remember me, baby?" His steel bull-like face gleamed in the darkness.

"You’re that guy… Colt, right?" Gally said, recognizing him. The bull-headed Colt snorted and nodded arrogantly.

"Of course you couldn’t forget me, baby. Just like I never forgot about you."

"Hoo, baby!" Colt growled. "So, are you a bounty target?" Gally took a step forward and cautiously asked, locking her gaze on Colt. He chuckled at her stance, answering with a sneer. 

"Oh, baby, are you a Hunter? That’s a surprise. I’m no fool, though—I haven't been reckless enough to end up on any wanted list. But if you’re in the mood for a fight..."

Colt suddenly grabbed one of his henchmen nearby. 

"Huh? What’s up, Colt?" The man barely finished his sentence before Colt casually snapped his neck, as if cracking an egg. The man's body convulsed, his pants staining with waste, before he went limp.

"Ahh, so that’s my future happy ending?" one of the thugs muttered, trembling.

"Haha... killing might be kinda fun, though," another grinned, his expression twisted. Each henchman reacted in their own bizarre way, but Colt continued, undeterred.

"Just how terrifying was it? Even though they were ready, not one of them tried to flee. Colt grabbed the hair of the man whose neck he had snapped and killed, supporting it with his left hand. Placing his right hand on the man's lower jaw, he moved the corpse's mouth as if performing ventriloquism, making it chatter as he shouted.

"Gwahahaha! Come on, baby! What's the price of murder? How much? How much is it... Tell me my hammer price, how much!"

Just as Gally was about to be overwhelmed by Colt's madness and vigor, a scream rose from behind her.

"Ah..."

Looking back, one of the men blocking Gally and Calico's escape route had fallen, and there stood a man in black attire who seemed to have emerged from the darkness.

"Ido... why..."

Gally involuntarily shouted, but the black-clad Ido stood there exuding a dangerous and dark aura, like a different person. As Gally felt a chill from Ido's demeanor and shivered, he quietly muttered."

"I didn't want you to see me like this... another me who enjoys killing."

As Gally stared at Ido, Calico's hand gently rested on her shoulder.

"I told them to call him for me, you know? I asked Sig and the others to arrange it."

"Heh heh, if you're going to become a Hunter anyway, you need to get proper guardian consent, right? Baby."

With that, Calico began to walk gracefully. There were still about eight of Colt's henchmen blocking the way.

"I'll handle these small fry, okay? It's a huge loss to use this outside of work, but I'll show you as a special treat—my full-power red-hot electromagnetic whip."

Calico suddenly dashed forward as if falling, unleashing a mid-level kick with incredible speed. It wasn't a kick that shot straight upward all at once, but a sweeping kick that cut horizontally.

As her leg extended, a thermal blade that had been stored inside shot out, and with a sizzling sound, she slashed through the bodies of five men at once.

"Ugh!"

"One of the three remaining men swung a thick blade resembling a machete and charged at Calico. Maintaining a cold smile, Calico shifted her stance to the side and sharply thrust her blade-protruding kicking leg like an ice pick. The man wielding the machete became a riddled mess in an instant and fell to the ground.

The remaining two trembled in fear at the power of Calico's kick. When one dropped his weapon and fled, the other followed suit.

"Oh dear, I went through the trouble of heating up my blade. Let me cut you some more, won't you?"

Calico licked her red lips with her tongue and swiftly closed the gap toward the two men fleeing with their backs turned.

"Shaaa!"

With a sharp exhale, she slashed one man's neck. The last one she cut straight down from the crown of his head to his groin with a spinning heel kick, flipping her body forward.

Calico had annihilated eight men in almost ten seconds. She smiled with satisfaction, having fully utilized her red-hot legs. Then, Calico said to Gally."

"Gu fu fu hi, baby, are you afraid of me? You're very, very scared, aren't you? That red woman says things like that, but I think it'll be tough to hunt me down alone. The guys that the black fellow and the red woman killed are nothing but numbers, as insignificant as farts. But you see, I...

Listen well, baby! To do what you want and get what you desire, you need to make an effort! And to fulfill your desires, you have to dedicate your soul—a pure soul in a life like mine!"

Colt leveled the shotgun he was holding horizontally and pulled the trigger right in front of his face.

"Pure thrusts with proper hip movement, powerful front kicks, side kicks—all of them seem simple and brute-force, but that's not all there is to them. Regardless of his nature or logic, Colt was a formidable warrior who had honed his own skills, and for Gally, he was an opponent she couldn't afford to underestimate at all."

"She was an opponent who should be confronted with strength.

"I'm doing my best too!"

Gally murmured as if convincing herself, adjusted her breathing, and focused her mind to recall memories of battle.

"Uooaaahhh! Oraaahhh! Hell Blaster!"

"Kyah!"

Gally took Colt's charge head-on. Spinning rapidly, she was blown back about ten meters. She managed to control her posture in midair and rolled to absorb the impact upon landing.

"Gally!"

Ido involuntarily shouted and tried to intervene, raising his hammer. Calico stopped him by placing a hand on his shoulder.

"What are you doing?"

"It's okay; she jumped back and took that hit on purpose. Let's watch her carefully for now, okay?"

Calico took a cigarette out of her coat pocket and pressed it against the thermal blade of her red-hot leg. "It's reckless. He's not as easy an opponent as you say. He may seem dim-witted, but his strength is first-class," she said.

As Calico exhaled a slow stream of purple smoke, she watched Gally and Colt's battle intently. "Gally insisted on doing it herself, right? Hunter-Warrior. When you're a Hunter, it's common to fight opponents of this level, you know? So every time that happens, are you always going to step in and help—"

Ido clenched his jaw as he watched the fight, shaking off Calico's hand from his shoulder. "Damn it, I understand that much, but still—"

"Well, you should just trust her, in that girl's strength," Calico replied.

Colt was relentlessly chasing after Gally, using charges and straight thrusts. "Damn it!"

"Gally parried and dodged, then retreated. Colt, with a confident smile, tried to corner Gally by showering her with continuous attacks.

'Hey, baby! What's wrong? Isn't running away getting very, very tiring? Even if you keep running, I won't get tired so easily. Baby, you'll never win. Buhyahya hyahyahya!'

Gally desperately tried to focus her mind, but the memories of battle deep within her heart wouldn't resurface as she wished. She was desperately hoping to remember something as she kept evading, but it seemed unlikely.

'What should I do? Me...'

'There's only one thing left!'

At the moment she shouted that, Gally stopped moving, adopting a welcoming stance with her arms spread wide open. Then she quietly closed her eyes.

'No!' 'Gally!'"

"Ido and Calico, who had been watching, stood up and shouted simultaneously. Gally had resolved to take Colt's attack head-on. By exposing herself to his blow and facing death, Gally bet her life on awakening something that should be sleeping within herself.

In that stance, Gally received Colt's straight thrust as if to embrace it; with a resounding 'thud,' she was sent flying head over heels.

"Babyyyyyy!"

At the moment his thrust directly struck Gally, Colt shed tears of joy. Gally was slammed into the ground, rolling over two or three times, and lay sprawled on the cold asphalt of the street.

"Ga... Gally!"

Ido rushed over, his whole body trembling. The handle of his hammer fell to the ground with a clattering sound.

"Gally, hey?""

Calico dropped the cigarette that had been hanging from the corner of her lips. Gally lay face down, not moving a muscle. Colt swung his bull-like head and let out a victorious roar into the night street.

Gally was dreaming—a silent, soundless scene like a black-and-white film tinted entirely in red, with blurred spots in her vision. Boulders rolled across a desolate land. In that land where sand danced and flew, Gally was standing still.

When she opened her eyes, asphalt was in front of her. Small pebbles embedded themselves into her cheek as she lay there. There was a metallic taste in her mouth. When she moved her tongue slightly, a gritty sensation spread across it—perhaps there were fragments of teeth among it.

Gally had stood up. Neither Ido, Calico, nor Colt saw the moment she rose. She had fallen before their very eyes, and they shouldn't have been able to look away from that scene, yet Gally was standing there.

"Well now, baby, you managed to get up. For a woman like you to appear..."

"I must thank God. When I met you back then and became obsessed with you, I must have already foreseen this moment," Colt said, raising his bull-like head high and sighing.

Then, facing Gally, who stood naturally, he readied his fists.

"Fuuuuuaaah!"

With a shout, Colt stepped forward with his right foot and unleashed a full-powered, lethal double-arm strike.

Gally let out a sharp breath, kicked upward from below, and lifted her vertical fist. Without resisting the upward momentum, she placed her hands on the ground as if performing a cartwheel, spinning both legs like a tornado to kick Colt.

With that single blow, Colt's fully extended right arm was shattered from the shoulder and blown several meters away, spinning and rolling on the road.

"Ungh! How does a baby like you have such destructive power!"

While trembling in fear, Colt simultaneously felt his brain numb with intense joy and madness that would have made him ejaculate if he were human.

"This is it, baby! Is this moment the terminal station of desire in my runaway express life?"

"Colt shook his head vigorously and charged at Gally while roaring. However, in the next moment, as Gally leaped, Colt lost sight of her.

'Gah! Where are you, my beloved baby! So you're trying to finish me off, huh? Gwahaha, I see! Earlier, you took my attack. Now it's my turn, right? Okay!'

Colt spread his remaining arm wide and shouted to the sky.

'I'll receive your love!'

In the next instant, Gally spiraled down from the sky in a straight line, embedding the heels of both her feet into the top of Colt's head like a drill. With a resounding thud, Colt's head was crushed. A liquid that was neither oil nor blood splattered around in fine droplets, making it seem as if a mist had formed for a moment.

'Uooooooh!'

Even after blowing off his head, Gally's rotation didn't stop, and she tore through Colt's body all at once. When Gally landed on the ground and made a sharp turn, stamping her feet, Colt's body was sliced from the crown of his head to his groin, turning into a swirling mass of shattered metal pieces centered around Gally..."


The wind died down, leaving the scattered debris rolling on the ground, and the night alley returned to stillness. The sound of Ido gulping down his spit echoed in the air.

"That... was that ancient martial arts from Mars?" Calico shuddered briefly, staring intently at Gally.

"My moves... that technique... Ah, I finally remember it now," Gally murmured quietly as she stood up, swaying slightly, and then gently collapsed as if a feather was falling.
