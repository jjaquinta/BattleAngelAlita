Gally wondered aloud, "Did Breda really ever get born?" 

Norinco gave her a strange look, then responded in a mocking tone, "What are you saying, Breda? Look, you're sitting right here, aren't you? It's strange, isn't it, doubting your own birth?"

Gally felt a headache coming on. Breda wasn’t born, she wasn’t alive, and yet Norinco insisted that his daughter Breda had been born. Gally found it increasingly hard to tolerate his insistence. "But, if your mother dies before giving birth, the baby usually dies too, right? So why would I be the exception? That doesn’t make sense."

When Gally said that, Norinco's face turned pale, and he stared at her with his blind, unseeing eyes. The cloth wrapped around his eyes was damp, stained with tears soaking through.
