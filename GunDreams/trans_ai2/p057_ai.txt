"Ah, Ido, where are you really going?" Gally clutched her head in frustration as she desperately pushed through the crowd, trying to catch up with Ido. Although Gally’s small frame was almost swallowed by the crowd, Ido’s tall figure made him easy to spot. All Gally had to do was keep her eyes on the black, Adamski-style hat that floated above the crowd.

Unaware that Gally was chasing after him, Ido paused two or three times to check the street before suddenly slipping into a narrow alley. 

"Oh no!" Gally pushed her way through the throng, determined to reach the alley Ido had disappeared into. She forcefully nudged aside a few people, trying to cut her way through the crowd.

"Ow! Ouch!" At that very moment, Gally slammed into an unexpected wall, the impact knocking her back and sending her crashing down onto her rear.

"Well, well... seems like Baby’s hammerhead is pretty tough!"
