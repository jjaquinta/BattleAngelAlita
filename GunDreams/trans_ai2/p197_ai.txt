"There's no doubt about it, that one's a serial killer," Calico said, shaking her head slightly while addressing Gally from atop her spider-like body. "Gally, it’s unfortunate, but you’re the only one who can take them down. They’re terrifyingly strong, and unlike me, they have an uncanny ability to counter fighters who rely on complex combination attacks. They can read the combos, close in, and slowly dismantle their opponent’s limbs bit by bit. It’s like watching a mantis systematically tear the wings off its prey, piece by piece."

As Calico scuttled back into the scrapyard's heaps, she left Gally with one final instruction. "Your unconventional attacks that ignore the centerline give you a real chance. Please, avenge me and Sig. Take them down, Gally."

"Calico... I understand," Gally said, pressing her lips together firmly as she dashed through the maze of scrap. Ahead of her, just as Calico had described, loomed the ruins of an old factory, bathed in the fading light.
