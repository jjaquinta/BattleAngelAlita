Norinco's wife, Belchere, gently stroked her growing belly and let out a soft sigh. He placed the bounty heads he had been holding on the table and cautiously walked over to the bed, softly touching his wife's swollen abdomen.

"Oh, oh... it's moving. The child inside you is the only thing that gives my life meaning. In this city, where dreams and hope are nonexistent, all I've ever wished for is to raise our child. That wish will soon come true. Thank you."

Belchere gently placed her hand over Norinco's steel one on her belly, shaking her head slightly as she spoke.

"I'm the one who should be thanking you, Norinco. You took in someone like me—just another woman leading a miserable life—and have treated me with such care, making me feel special."

Hearing her words, Norinco's expression clouded, and he averted his eyes.

"No... I'm not a man worthy of your gratitude. To be honest, any woman who could bear my child would have sufficed for me. And for that, I'm truly sorry."
