"Haha, there's no way, is there?"

Ido shook his head, denying the thought as he crouched down. No matter how tightly sealed the cyborg’s skull was, the brain itself was "organic." After hundreds of years, it would have decomposed and broken down into liquid or at best, powder.

"I'm doing something pointless, aren’t I?"

Ido muttered with a wry smile, yet he was drawn in once more as he slowly lifted the girl’s body, gently cupping her head in his hands.

As a cybernetic doctor, Ido's medical knowledge and experience went far beyond that of others. In The Scrapyard, where comprehensive doctors like Ido were rare, he had the ability to diagnose whether there was liquid or powder inside the girl’s skull through careful palpation or percussion.

Ido carefully lifted the girl's head, moving it from side to side, lightly tapping it. And it didn’t take long for something to show — the result made his eyes widen in shock, and his face flushed red.

...Impossible. Could this really be happening?
