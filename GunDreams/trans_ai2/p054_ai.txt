She saw him. He was dragging a large trunk case beside him. It was a side of Ido that Gally had never seen before. The thought of Ido going into town without her knowing lit a spark of curiosity deep in Gally's heart. As her artificial heart throbbed rhythmically, that spark quickly spread, igniting an uncontrollable flame. 

"Where could he be going...?" 

Though she felt a bit of fear toward the unknown night streets, it wasn’t enough to stop the growing curiosity inside her. "What could he be doing, keeping it a secret from me?" 

With that thought, Gally bolted out of her room and out of the clinic. She dashed into the night, chasing after Ido’s disappearing figure, dressed in black, as he vanished into the shadows of The Scrapyard.

The pleasure district of the eastern part of The Scrapyard. At night, it transformed into a dazzling paradise, bathed in garish neon lights that were as bright as heaven and as poisonous as hell.
