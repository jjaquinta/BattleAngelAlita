### Chapter 3

The colossal ivory pillar that anchored the floating city of Zalem descended like the elegant curve of a wine glass stem, flaring outward into a bell-shaped terminus high above the earth. Yet, this once-beautiful bell was grotesquely marred—the tip shattered as if gnawed by some celestial beast. From its mutilated end, a relentless cascade of waste spewed downward like tainted blood, a torrent of refuse raining upon the world below.

The detritus fell continuously.

"Ah, it's already past noon," Ido murmured as a distant rumble reverberated through the streets. The ceaseless flow of waste from Zalem accumulated in a towering slag heap over a thousand meters high at the center of **The Scrapyard**. Each new avalanche of debris crashed onto the peak, sending tremors through the ground and echoing thunder across the city.

In **The Scrapyard**, this periodic clamor served as a crude chronometer. The midday quake signaled the end of the morning's labors, a customary respite locals referred to as "half-day." Familiar with this routine, Ido used the tremors to gauge the hour.

"Hey, Gally, come over here," he called.

Seated in a wheelchair nearby, Gally met his gaze with a mixture of anxiety and anticipation. She was transformed. Her mechanical limbs were fully integrated, and her newly crafted body possessed the youthful, feminine contours of a girl in her prime.

Just days earlier, Ido had secured the parts for her legs. That morning had been devoted to attaching them.

"Okay, I'm coming," Gally replied.

She placed her hands on the armrests, applying pressure to lift herself. Her fingers, now delicate yet strong, tightened with determination.

"That's it, you can do it!" Ido cheered, his fists clenched in excitement.

Gally hesitated momentarily before pushing herself up. Ido instinctively stepped forward, ready to catch her if she faltered. She carefully placed one foot on the ground, testing her balance as if dipping a toe into uncertain waters. Then, she set down the other foot, her posture wavering but resolute.

"I... Ido..." she whispered.

Her face was a canvas of fear and resolve. Reaching out toward him, she took a tentative step, then another. Ido's heart swelled. He moved closer and embraced her as she stumbled into his arms.

"You're doing it, Gally!" he exclaimed.

A radiant smile spread across her face. "I'm so relieved. It seems my body still remembers how to walk. Hey, Ido, does this mean I've finally become... me?"

He held her at arm's length, looking into her eyes. "Getting your body back is just the beginning. Your life starts now. You have to keep living from here on."

"Keep living..." Gally echoed, her gaze drifting as she pondered his words. Until now, her existence had been a gift from Ido—a second chance salvaged from the wreckage of the past. But was it truly her own life? A flicker of uncertainty ignited within her.

As she grew more comfortable in her new form, questions began to stir. What did it mean to live? To be herself?

Later, as twilight painted the sky with hues of amber and violet, Gally carried a tray with a water jug into the living room. Gonzu, an old friend of Ido's, was just rising unsteadily from the table, his face flushed from drink.

"Oh, Gonzu, are you leaving already?" Gally asked.

He nodded, wobbling slightly. "Yeah, if I drink any more here, I'll end up staying the night. Better continue at my own place."

Ido, who had been sharing a light drink with him, leaned back in his chair. "You know you're always welcome to stay."

Gonzu chuckled, waving a dismissive hand. "Heh, I know you too well. Don't want to impose. See you around."

Gally watched as he made his way to the door, then returned to find Ido stretching with a yawn.

"I'm tired today," he said, rubbing his eyes. "And with the drink in me... I think I'll turn in early."

Gally tugged gently at his sleeve. "Hey, Ido, are you really going to sleep already? Weren't you going to tell me more about the outside world?"

Since gaining mobility, Gally had been voraciously curious, eager to learn everything she could about **The Scrapyard**. Each story Ido shared was a window into a world she longed to understand.

He smiled apologetically. "I'm sorry, but let's continue another time. I've been busy, but in a couple of days, I'll take you to see the lively streets. For now, try to get some rest."

She pouted slightly but nodded. "Alright."

Ido stood and gave her a gentle pat on the head before heading toward his room. Left alone, Gally sighed and made her way to her own quarters.

"Another day ending already..." she murmured as she settled into bed. The room dimmed as she switched off the lights, moonlight casting a silvery glow through the curtains.

Sleep did not come easily. Hours passed as she lay awake, thoughts swirling like leaves in an eddy. Just as she felt herself drifting, a subtle sound stirred her.

Footsteps.

They were soft but distinct, echoing faintly in the silence. Gally's eyes opened. She sat up, listening intently. The steps moved past her door, descending the stairs. Then, the faint creak of the clinic's front door opening and closing.

Curiosity piqued, she slipped out of bed and padded silently to the window. Peering through a gap in the curtain, she saw a figure moving along the street below.

Ido.

He was dressed in black, dragging a large trunk behind him—a side of him she had never seen.

"Where is he going at this hour?" she whispered.

A spark of intrigue ignited within her, quickly fanning into a flame. The unknown beckoned, and despite a flicker of apprehension, she felt compelled to follow.

Without hesitation, Gally hurried downstairs and slipped into the night, pursuing Ido's shadow as it melded into the labyrinth of **The Scrapyard**.

---

The eastern pleasure district was a cacophony of light and sound—a nocturnal carnival where neon signs blazed like artificial suns, bathing the streets in kaleidoscopic hues. It was a realm where the line between heaven and hell blurred, a place teeming with life yet devoid of warmth.

Gally navigated the throng, her senses overwhelmed by the onslaught. Vendors hawked dubious wares, holographic advertisements flickered and danced, and the air was thick with the mingled scents of spice, smoke, and sweat.

"This is... too much," she muttered, feeling a wave of dizziness.

Her eyes searched the crowd, seeking the familiar silhouette of Ido. His tall frame and distinctive hat served as a beacon amidst the sea of faces.

Unaware of her pursuit, Ido weaved through the masses with practiced ease. Suddenly, he veered into a narrow alley.

"Wait!" Gally quickened her pace, but the press of bodies slowed her progress.

She pushed forward, only to collide with a solid barrier. The impact sent her stumbling backward, landing hard on the pavement.

"Well, well... seems like the little lady's in a hurry," a deep voice rumbled.

Looking up, Gally found herself staring at a towering figure—a full-body cyborg with the head of a steel bull. His metallic visage glinted under the neon lights, eyes glowing with a predatory gleam.

"I'm sorry," she stammered, scrambling to her feet.

"Sorry doesn't cut it, sweetheart," he sneered. "You nearly dented my delicate frame."

He pressed a massive hand to his chest in mock offense. The crowd around them began to part, onlookers drawn by the unfolding confrontation.

Gally's heart raced. "I didn't mean to—"

"What's a cute thing like you doing out here alone?" he interrupted, stepping closer. "Dangerous place for someone so... fragile."

She retreated a step, glancing around for an escape. The faces surrounding them were indifferent, some amused, none sympathetic.

"I'm just passing through," she said, trying to keep her voice steady.

He chuckled darkly. "Oh, I think you'll be staying a while."

He raised a fist the size of her head. "Let's see how tough you really are."

Time seemed to slow as he swung at her. Instinctively, Gally ducked, the fist whistling past her ear with inches to spare. Seizing the moment, she darted beneath his arm, slipping through the narrow gap.

"Hey!" he bellowed, momentarily off-balance.

Behind her, she heard the sickening crunch of metal as his missed punch connected with an unfortunate bystander.

"That brat!" the bull-headed cyborg roared.

Gally didn't look back. She wove through the crowd, adrenaline surging as she sought refuge.

"Over here, dear!"

A voice beckoned from a nearby alcove. Gally hesitated but then saw a plump woman with a warm smile, waving her over. Heavy makeup adorned her raccoon-like face, eyes bright with concern.

"Come on, quickly," the woman urged.

Desperate, Gally accepted the offer, allowing herself to be pulled into a side alley. The noise of the main street faded, replaced by the muffled hum of distant revelry.

"Thank you," Gally breathed.

The woman leaned against a graffiti-stained wall, catching her breath. "Name's Shig. You alright?"

"Gally," she replied. "I think so."

Shig studied her for a moment. "What were you doing out there alone? This part of town isn't safe for someone like you."

"I was... looking for someone," Gally admitted.

Shig sighed. "Well, you nearly found trouble instead. That brute you bumped into is Colt—a real piece of work. Best to steer clear."

Gally nodded, still shaken. "I didn't realize..."

"Tell you what," Shig offered. "Why don't I help you find your friend?"

Before Gally could respond, she noticed a subtle change in Shig's demeanor. The warmth in her eyes cooled, replaced by a calculating edge.

"Actually," Shig continued, her tone shifting, "there's something you can help me with."

A shadow fell over Gally's face. "What do you mean?"

From the depths of the alley, figures emerged—women with hardened expressions, surrounding them. Gally's pulse quickened.

Shig smirked. "You've got some valuable parts there, sweetheart. Arms, legs... I've seen them before."

Confusion washed over her. "These? I don't understand."

"Those limbs belong to girls who've gone missing," Shig hissed. "Friends of ours. And you show up wearing them? Doesn't look good."

Gally's mind reeled. "No, I... Ido fixed me. He gave me these."

"Ido?" The name rippled through the group like a spark igniting dry tinder.

"He's the one," another woman snarled. "He's the killer."

"Wait!" Gally protested. "Ido isn't a killer! He saved me!"

Shig drew a slender blade, its edge glinting ominously. "Enough lies. We're going to make sure he gets the message."

Panic surged. The circle tightened as knives were drawn.

"I don't want to die," Gally whispered, fear gripping her.

As Shig lunged, time seemed to fracture. In a split second, something deep within Gally awakened—a dormant instinct surging to the surface.

With fluid precision, she caught the descending blade between her palms. The metal shattered, fragments scattering like sparks.

Shig stumbled back, eyes wide with disbelief. The other women recoiled, shock etched on their faces.

"What are you?" Shig gasped.

Gally stood slowly, a newfound confidence radiating from her. "I... I don't know."

The alley fell silent. One by one, the women retreated, pulling Shig with them. Fear had supplanted their anger.

---

Alone once more, Gally trembled. "What... just happened?"

Her heart raced, the adrenaline ebbing to reveal a mix of exhilaration and dread. Fragments of forgotten skills flickered in her mind—combat techniques that felt both foreign and intimately familiar.

"Is this who I was?" she wondered aloud.

Before she could delve deeper, a chilling presence manifested behind her.

"Impressive," a voice remarked, cool and edged like a blade.

Gally spun around to face the newcomer—a tall woman with fiery red hair styled like a spiked crown. She wore a sleek leather coat, and behind silver-framed glasses, her eyes gleamed with predatory interest.

"Who are you?" Gally demanded, tension coiling within her.

The red-haired woman smiled thinly. "Just someone who's been hired to deal with a certain problem."

"You're after Ido," Gally realized, her fists clenching.

"So he is involved," the woman mused. "Interesting."

Without warning, Gally launched herself forward, driven by a surge of protectiveness. "I won't let you hurt him!"

The woman sidestepped gracefully, but Gally anticipated the move, adjusting mid-strike. Their limbs blurred in a rapid exchange—kicks, blocks, feints.

For a moment, they stood locked in a stalemate, each assessing the other.

"Not bad," the woman admitted. "But you're out of your depth."

She moved with blinding speed, delivering a calculated blow that sent Gally crashing into the wall. Pain radiated through her as she struggled to stand.

The woman approached, peering down with a mix of curiosity and pity. "You're connected to Ido, aren't you? Perhaps his daughter?"

Gally shook her head weakly. "He saved me... that's all."

A flicker of something crossed the woman's face—sympathy, perhaps.

"Then you should stay out of this," she advised. "This world is harsher than you realize."

As darkness encroached on the edges of her vision, Gally fought to remain conscious. "Ido... please be safe..."

Her strength waned, and she slipped into unconsciousness, the last image seared into her mind—the red-haired woman turning away, a silent enigma cloaked in shadows.

---

Gally awoke to the soft glow of morning filtering through a dusty window. Her body ached, but she was alive.

"Where... am I?" she murmured.

"You'll be fine," a familiar voice assured her.

Turning her head, she saw the red-haired woman seated nearby, arms crossed.

"Why did you..." Gally began.

The woman met her gaze. "Consider it a professional courtesy. You're not my target."

Gally sat up slowly. "Thank you."

"Don't mention it." The woman stood, adjusting her coat. "But heed my warning. Stay out of this."

"Wait," Gally called after her. "What's your name?"

She paused at the doorway, glancing back. "It's Calico."

With that, she vanished into the labyrinth of **The Scrapyard**, leaving Gally with more questions than answers.

---

Determined, Gally rose, despite the protests of her battered body. She had to find Ido, to warn him of the danger that lurked.

As she stepped into the bustling streets, a resolve hardened within her.

No matter what secrets lay hidden, she would uncover them. For herself, and for the man who had given her a second chance at life.
