Calico lit the cigarette held between her lips and asked Ido. He didn't answer for a while, stroking Gally's hair, but then suddenly began to speak as if to himself.

"I don't know much about Panzer Kunst. But I've heard that it's a legendary martial art that was destroyed because it was terrifyingly powerful. It's probably called the ancient Martian martial art for that reason."

By now, that fact had faded into oblivion, but in the former space age, humanity had reached Venus, Mars, and Jupiter, and had built unique cultures on each planet. Among them, especially the Martian Panzer Kunst wielded terrible power in wars through assassinations and guerrilla warfare, and thus was feared as "On Mars, there is Panzer Kunst."

"Heh, I see... Indeed, the principles are quite different from our Earth-style martial arts. Even watching that technique, I can't imagine the battlefield is limited to the ground, you know," Calico said.

Calico walked over to Gally, who was held by Ido, gently placed her hand on the girl's cheek, and smiled as if praising her brave fight. However, that smile gave Ido a chilling sense of unease. Contrary to the mask of her smile, her eyes harbored a golden light filled with the instinctive hostility of a woman's jealousy hidden within.
