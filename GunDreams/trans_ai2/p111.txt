When Shig screamed and looked up at the sky, there was a shadow bracing itself with both hands and feet against the walls of the buildings that formed the alley. The shadow's lips twisted, and blood traced down, forming a long string that hung and fell directly onto Shig's forehead.

"Aaghhhaaahhh!!"

Shig's death scream echoed fiercely off the narrow alley walls, but it died away before it could reach the street of the entertainment district, twenty meters away.

The quiet returned to the junkyard town at night. Amidst the scattered cyborg corpses lying in the alley, Gally (Alita), having fought to exhaustion, collapsed onto the ground as if she were merely sleeping, unconscious.

"You did well, Gally," Ido whispered as he gently picked up the fallen Gally, brushing the disheveled hair from her bruised and dirtied face with a tender hand.

"...Hey, can I ask? This martial art she used—whether it's an ancient Martian fighting style or some kind of mechanized combat technique—what exactly is it?"
