It was so terrifying, yet not a single person tried to flee. Colt grabbed the dead man’s hair with his left hand, holding the head up while placing his right hand beneath the chin, manipulating the corpse like a ventriloquist’s dummy. 

With exaggerated movements, Colt made the dead man’s mouth move as he yelled, "Gwahaha! So, baby, what’s my bounty? How much? Tell me my hammer price—how much am I worth?"

As Gally nearly recoiled from Colt’s madness, a scream erupted behind her.

Turning around, she saw one of the men blocking their escape had been taken down, and a figure cloaked in black seemed to materialize from the darkness.

"Ido… why…?" Gally called out in shock, but this Ido exuded a menacing and dark aura, different from the man she knew. The chilling presence made Gally shiver, and Ido quietly muttered something under his breath.
