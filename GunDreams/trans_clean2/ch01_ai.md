# CHAPTER 1

The night air was thick with tension, shadows shifting under the pale light of a broken moon. A figure sprinted through the narrow alleys of **The Scrapyard**, breath ragged and frantic.

"Kihee!"

The man's wild cry echoed off crumbling walls. Sparks from torn cables flickered in the dark, casting fleeting glimpses of his panicked figure. He was a half-cyborg, part of his head and his left arm replaced by cold, impersonal machinery. In his augmented hand, he clutched a machete, its blade slick with the dark stain of fresh blood.

This part of **The Scrapyard** was a forsaken zone, far from the neon-lit pleasure districts. Here, grimy alleys twisted like capillaries through the skeletal remains of long-abandoned buildings. The man darted through the labyrinth, his steps erratic, his mind unraveling.

"I'll be killed... I'll be melted..." His voice trembled, as if the very air had conspired against him. The walls distorted in his vision, twisting and writhing like the pulsating tongues of some unseen predator. 

Still, he ran, plunging deeper into the maze, hallucinations gnawing at his sanity. In the corners of his perception, the dark alleys whispered promises of doom, acid seeping from every crack, ready to dissolve him into nothing. His brain, saturated with alkaloids from a mescaline-fueled trip, spiraled into madness.

Behind him, footsteps. Close. Closer.

The man’s escape ended in a dead end, a filthy river of sewer water blocking his path. Trembling, he pressed his back against a wire fence, eyes wide with terror as he peered into the shadows of the alley he’d just fled. The oppressive walls seemed to loom over him, crushing inwards. 

“No! Stop it!” He shrieked, slashing at his own arm, the blade biting deep into flesh. The sharp, pulsing pain cut through the fog of his mind, momentarily bringing him back to reality. Blood oozed from his wounds, but he welcomed the clarity.

"Serves you right... serves you right..." he muttered, laughing a dry, cracked laugh. His hallucinations faded, but the real danger that had driven him into this hell remained.

A low voice emerged from the shadows.

"So, you’ve finally stopped running, Mr. 90,050 chips."

His bloodshot eyes strained against the darkness, and a silhouette took form. A shadow, as black as the void itself, stepped into the flickering light. 

"You're not a hallucination, are you, you damn Hunter?" The man’s voice quivered with rage, but beneath it was the unmistakable note of fear.

The figure dropped a rolled-up bounty list at his feet, crushing it beneath a booted heel. The dim light glinted off cold steel. 

“Don’t think it’ll be easy.”

The man’s posture shifted. He wiped the blood from his right arm, lowered his stance, and brandished his knife. There was a practiced grace in his movement—a muscle memory born from countless battles. He had survived the carnage of the streets before.

The shadow sighed. “A serial killer like you... would fetch a slightly better bounty if you hadn’t only targeted women. But a hunter will do for today.”

With a guttural shout, the man launched himself forward, his blade arcing through the air. His mechanical left arm surged with power, driving the knife toward the shadow’s head, its edge whistling through the darkness. 

It was the same lethal technique that had sent many to their graves. But this time, something was different.

The shadow's eyes flashed—a glint of red reflecting off the dull blade.

A crimson arc of light cut through the darkness, tracing upward from the shadow’s feet. In the same instant, a sharp, metallic ring echoed through the alley, reverberating off the walls. The man's blow had missed—no, it had been intercepted with impossible precision.

"W-what...?"

He hadn’t felt the satisfaction of the knife biting into flesh, the thrill of a kill. Instead, his hand grasped at empty air. The force of his own momentum sent him tumbling, and he hit the ground hard, rolling onto his back.

"My hand!" The man’s scream split the night. His left wrist, once an unyielding weapon of steel and circuitry, was now a clean, severed stump. Smoke rose from the glowing edges of the cut.

The shadow loomed over him, untouched.

"What the hell just happened?"

A moment later, his severed hand and the knife it clutched fell beside him, the blade embedding itself in the pavement like a gravestone.

The truth dawned on him too late. The shadow had kicked his wrist in mid-swing, severing it with inhuman speed. The technique had been flawless—more than flawless. It had been a display of martial artistry beyond anything he had seen. But how could a kick sever metal?

The man’s confusion turned to dread as the figure stepped forward, pinning him to the ground with a single, mechanical foot.

"D-Damn it!" He cursed, twisting his neck to look up at his tormentor.

What he saw was a tall, slender figure, her body cloaked in a long, tattered coat that barely concealed the gleaming metal beneath. Her silver-framed glasses caught the faint light, and her red, pineapple-like hair gleamed ominously in the darkness.

"A woman?" The man croaked, disbelief choking his words.

"Heh. At least that's what the chromosomes say," she replied, her lips curling into a smirk. But it wasn’t her gender that unnerved him. It was the cold, mechanical precision of her full-body cybernetic frame.

The woman bent down, resting an elbow on the knee of the foot pressing him into the dirt. Her smile was cruel, her red lips twisting with dark amusement.

"You thought you could outrun me?" she asked, her voice a low rasp. "A killer like you... 90,050 chips? What a waste of a cartridge."

She gestured to her leg. From beneath her coat, the sheen of her mechanical shin caught the light. A bolt-like handle jutted out from it, and with a quick pull, a cartridge ejected, clattering onto the ground.

"Heat-ray blade," she said, tapping her shin. "It’s what severed your arm. Cost me a fortune to use, but I guess you were worth it... just barely."

The man shuddered as the reality of his situation hit him. His bravado drained away, replaced by cold, gnawing terror. "P-Please... don’t..."

But the woman wasn’t listening. She stepped harder on his back, eliciting a sickening crunch. 

"I love that sound," she whispered, her eyes gleaming behind her glasses.

She raised her foot, and with surgical precision, drove the heated blade down. His last thoughts were of home—distant memories of a life before the drugs, before **The Scrapyard**. His final words were no more than a whisper.

“Dad... Mom...”

When the woman was finished, she lifted his severed head in one hand and, without a word, disappeared into the alley. The wind caught the hem of her coat, a fluttering shadow in the night.

As the clouds drifted away, the moonlight bathed the alley in a cold, blue glow. There, next to the lifeless body, the knife stood like a gravestone, a silent witness to the violence.

The woman’s name was **Calico**.
