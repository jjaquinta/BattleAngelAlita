At that moment, Gally screamed in fear and ducked low, bending her body forward to slip under the bull-headed cyborg’s downward punch. As the fist whizzed past, the wind pressure ripped several strands of hair from her head, and Gally dashed through the opening, sliding past under his armpit.

"F***!"

The bull-headed cyborg's straight punch missed Gally and instead smashed into a nearby cyborg who was unlucky enough to be passing by.

"Guhee!"

The unfortunate cyborg was struck in the side and bent over in pain, collapsing like a folding chair. A sickening crack echoed as the cyborg's artificial spine snapped, sending spinal fluid splattering everywhere.

“Sh*t, that baby got away!” 

By the time the bull-headed cyborg turned back with an angry snort, Gally had already disappeared into the crowd.

“Hey, hey, little miss! Wait up! Come over here!” 

Gally was still frantically fleeing from the bull-headed cyborg, weaving through the throng of people as she ran for her life.
