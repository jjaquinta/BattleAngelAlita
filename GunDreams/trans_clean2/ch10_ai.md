### CHAPTER 10

"You're not going again tonight? Have you already given up being a Hunter?" Ido's voice echoed through the afternoon air as he once again extended an invitation to Gally. The familiarity of his plea mirrored the countless times before, but like the last, her hesitation remained unchanged.

"Well, it's not that... it's just... I guess I'm starting to wonder why I always have to go with you, Ido," Gally replied, her full lips pursing slightly in frustration.

Ido couldn't resist teasing her. "That's because your way of fighting isn't exactly top-notch. You keep fighting like you did against Colt every time. Look, if you keep this up, you're going to end up in a situation you can't come back from!"

Gally fell silent, biting her lip even harder, the weight of his words pressing down on her.

"Well then, what should I do if some sleazy guy attacks me, huh, Ido?" she retorted, her voice edged with defiance.

Unable to contain his frustration, Ido slammed his fist against the wall, his patience wearing thin. "You run away."

Offended by his harshness, Gally glared at him sharply. "I don't want to do that. That's just cowardly!"

"And that's exactly why I can't let you be a Hunter on your own! Have you ever thought about how I feel when you come back hurt? Until you fix that impulsiveness of yours, there's no way I can let you be a Hunter!"

Ido's words stung, but Gally met his intensity head-on. "Fine, whatever!" she snapped.

Deep down, Gally knew she yearned for Ido to recognize her potential as a formidable Hunter. "Yeah. I can handle things better than you think, Ido," she declared firmly before dashing out of the house. Left behind, Ido trembled as his repressed emotions finally erupted. "Damn it, damn it! She's mine! Mine!" Overcome with rage, he spent three days tearing apart the room in a fit of anger.

---

After leaving the house, Gally made her way to Bergman's shop to pick up a combat body customized just for her. "The design's a bit old-fashioned, but the horsepower is double that of the Cyprian model. The outer shell is made of special self-locking armor, so no ordinary blade can get through. Renting this bad boy for a week costs 30,000 chips—pretty reasonable, eh? What do you think, missy?" Bergman grinned widely as Gally nervously lay down on the operating table, uncertainty flickering in her eyes.

"Uh, Bergman... are you sure you can really switch my body properly?" Gally's voice wavered slightly.

Bergman frowned, his lips pursing before he snorted confidently. "You think I can't handle this? I may be a retired ball player, but swapping bodies is a piece of cake for me. Sure, I just picked it up by watching machine engineers, but I've done all the body swaps in this shop myself."

Though initially uneasy, Gally watched as Bergman swiftly and skillfully completed the body swap. "Wow... you're even faster than Ido," she murmured, genuinely impressed as she admired her new body—unpainted and purely metallic in appearance.

"How's it feel? Any problems or discomfort?" Bergman inquired.

Gally threw a couple of kicks to test her new form, the response leagues beyond her previous civilian model. The neural and mechanical systems operated on an entirely different level. Previously, she'd sometimes felt a sense of heaviness or awkwardness in her movements, but now, there was almost no weight to hold her back.

"Thanks, Bergman. I love it!" Gally exclaimed, her excitement evident. She donned the jacket and pants that came with her new body and left the shop. "Hey, girl, if you break it, you'll have to buy it or pay for the repairs!" Bergman's loud, hearty laughter echoed after her as she stepped out into the street, now looking sharp and well-equipped.

---

"Maybe it's because I was told not to meet her..." Gally thought to herself as she navigated toward the entertainment district after acquiring the combat body. An irresistible urge to see Calico gnawed at her. As always, she blended into the crowd, walking slowly and weaving through the gaps between people.

**But why doesn’t Ido want me to meet Calico?**

When Gally woke up from a two-day coma, the first thing she mentioned was Calico. Ido reacted sensitively to her casual remark, issuing a warning. "...Calico and Sig were killed by a murderer?" Gally was shocked by the revelation.

"Yeah, it happened the day Sig brought you to see Calico," Ido responded. The following morning, after the rain, they found Sig dead—her body minced into tiny pieces. As for Calico, she fought the killer by the riverbank along the sewer but was torn apart and killed as well.

Gally left the Pink Cabaret and walked aimlessly down the street, deeply troubled. She couldn’t believe that Calico had been defeated. It was unimaginable to her that someone as skilled as Calico could lose in a one-on-one fight. To make matters worse, no trace of the culprit was found at the scene, indicating that the assailant had likely walked away without a scratch.

"I’ll never be able to fight Calico again..." Gally murmured, her head bowed. Just then, her ears picked up the sound of a man's threatening voice, a woman's shriek, and the faint pleading and cries of an old man, all emanating from the edge of the crowded street.

"Please... please forgive me," pleaded the old man.

"Shut up, you filthy old geezer! This ain’t a place for stinking scum like you, got it?" snarled one of the thugs.

"Yeah, finish him off, finish him!" squealed one of the women, egging them on.

"He's so annoying! Just kill the old man already!"

Intrigued by the commotion, Gally glanced over to see a gang of lowlifes and a few obnoxious women surrounding a homeless old man, mercilessly beating him. It seemed the old man had begged for some change, leading the women to call for the thugs' help. Excited by the attention from the women, the thug, his face flushed with excitement, continued kicking the old man, who repeatedly begged for mercy while laughing cruelly.

"Hey, that's enough. Cut it out," Gally commanded, stepping casually into the middle of the beating. She helped the battered old man up, only to realize it was someone she had met before—the blind old man, Norinco, who had tried to sell scraps to Bergman's shop only to be chased away. "You're Norinco, right? Are you okay?" Gally asked, concern lacing her voice.

"Hey, who the hell are you?! You think just 'cause you’re a bit cute that I’ll let you get away with this?!" The thug, frustrated by Gally's interruption, sneered at her and pulled out a knife. Without a word, Gally grabbed the thug's knife and effortlessly bent the blade with a sharp twist. The man let out a terrified yelp before running off, and the women who had been cheering him on scattered like frightened insects into the crowd.

"Serves them right," Gally snorted, ready to leave when she suddenly felt the old man cling to her from behind.

"Oh, Breda! Even during the day, you're here to help me. What a kind child you are!" Norinco muttered.

"Wait, hold on! Norinco, I'm not Breda. I’m Gally!" she exclaimed, startled. Gally shook off Norinco's grip, trying to explain, but the old man, with tears streaming from beneath the cloth covering his eyes, continued to call her "Breda, Breda."

"This is troublesome... Come on, enough already," Gally muttered, though normally she would have reacted more aggressively. A thought flickered in her mind—Norinco had once been a renowned Hunter. Perhaps, by pretending to be Breda, she could uncover the old man's legendary past as a Hunter. Her curiosity ignited, Gally decided to tolerate the discomfort of being mistaken for someone else.

"Alright, I understand. Could you tell me your story, Norinco? Today, you can share it with... Breda," Gally said, sitting beside the Breda doll placed on the cart's seat.

"Sigh... I am a worthless person," Norinco admitted, addressing Gally as Breda. "I have no reason to keep living."

"Then why are you still alive?" Gally pressed, her voice tinged with frustration.

"Fushushuu... Of course, Breda. I live only to raise you," he replied. Norinco had neither the strength nor the will to live for himself anymore. He considered himself nothing more than a lump of flesh. Yet, the only reason he continued to live was for Breda's sake alone.

"I exist only as a body for Breda. It's strange that I even have a consciousness at all. Fushushuu... After all, I died when I lost my sight," Norinco continued, recounting his sorrowful past to Gally. He explained how he had lost his body in an accident and became a bounty hunter to afford the expensive fertility treatments necessary to have a child. He had arranged for a woman named Belchea to undergo the procedure, and she became pregnant. But near the time of birth, due to his negligence, both Belchea and the unborn child were burned alive. Consumed by guilt, Norinco had gouged out his own eyes.

Gally could understand the depth of his pain and regret up until that point, but what followed became difficult for her to comprehend. "Breda... Belchea protected you from the inferno when she died," Norinco said. Gally asked, "So, did Belchea give birth to the child before she burned to death?"

"Fushushuu... If she had given birth in that fire, you would have burned to death too. It’s because she didn’t give birth that you were saved. If you had been partially born, even with one hand out of her womb and burned, I would have become an even more unforgivable lump of flesh than I am now," Norinco explained.

Gally furrowed her brows, deep in thought. She had never heard of a dead woman giving birth to a living child. "Is it really possible for a living baby to be born from a woman who has died in a fire?"

Norinco chuckled, his body shaking as he nodded repeatedly. "Fushuu... Under normal circumstances, no. But you were born. In the face of that fact, whether Belchea was alive or dead is such a small detail, isn’t it?"

Gally sighed, glancing at the mannequin-headed doll. Norinco continued to treat Breda as if she had been born from Belchea in those tragic circumstances. Gally wondered aloud, "Did Breda really ever get born?"

Norinco gave her a strange look, then responded in a mocking tone. "What are you saying, Breda? Look, you're sitting right here, aren't you? It's strange, isn't it, doubting your own birth?"

Gally felt a headache coming on. Breda wasn’t born, she wasn’t alive, and yet Norinco insisted that his daughter Breda had been born. Gally found it increasingly hard to tolerate his insistence. "But, if your mother dies before giving birth, the baby usually dies too, right? So why would I be the exception? That doesn’t make sense."

When Gally said that, Norinco's face turned pale, and he stared at her with his blind, unseeing eyes. The cloth wrapped around his eyes was damp, stained with tears soaking through. "Fushuuu... Breda, oh, how could this be? You’re trying to deny your own miraculous birth. You seem like a completely different person from your usual gentle and wise self. I swear, I saw it with my own eyes that snowy night. When dead Perché was bathed in light, you descended from the heavens, smiling down on me," Norinco lamented.

Gally, frustrated, responded firmly. "But your eyes couldn't see by then, right? That was just a hallucination. Breda died in Perché's womb."

Determined to make Norinco understand that the idea of Breda's birth was merely an illusion, Gally pressed on. "Even if I couldn’t see, I know what I saw! And if it’s not true, then the proof that you’re alive is also a fantasy... and my only reason for living too... Oh, Breda, you’re my only light, so why are you so stubborn about denying yourself?"

Norinco's anguish deepened. "Even if I couldn’t see, I know what I saw! And if it’s not true, then the proof that you’re alive is also a fantasy... and my only reason for living too... Oh, Breda, you’re my only light, so why are you so stubborn about denying yourself?"

At that, Gally's frustration peaked. She grabbed the Breda doll, jumped off the rickshaw, and shouted back at him. "Listen carefully, Norinco. Breda was never born. This is just a doll," she declared firmly. "You know that deep down, don't you?"

"A doll? Breda, a doll? Fushuuu, what are you saying, Breda?" Norinco asked, confusion etched into his features. Gally handed him the lifeless Breda doll and shook him gently.

"Look, it doesn’t move at all. It doesn’t even have a pulse. This is just a shell, a part of a cyborg—it’s only a doll. And the one talking to you right now is me, Gally. My name is Gally."

Norinco clutched the lifeless form of Breda in his arms, trembling as he tried to reject the painful truth. He began to sweat as he heard the voice of a girl—clearly not Breda—speaking to him from another direction.

"What's wrong, Breda? Why aren’t you speaking to me today like you usually do? Why are you so limp?" he asked, desperation lacing his voice.

"Breda was born... she was born..." Norinco muttered, his voice barely audible.

"You’ve been lying to yourself all this time because you couldn’t forgive yourself, but that’s not right," Gally responded, her voice filled with frustration.

Norinco let out a long, anguished cry, unable to accept the truth. Clutching the Breda doll tightly, he suddenly bolted at an unnaturally fast speed, far beyond the limits of his frail, worn-out cyborg legs. "Ah, Norinco!" Gally cried out, stunned by his unexpected reaction, and froze in place for a moment.

"I want to know the truth. I have to know the truth. Isn’t knowing the truth the path to happiness?" Gally genuinely believed this without doubt. She didn’t understand that for the elderly Norinco, knowing the truth meant despair. Yet, a strange, uncomfortable feeling weighed heavily in her chest.

Gally ran through the alleyways, trying to catch up to Norinco, but he was already out of sight. "Where did he go?" she muttered, searching the streets over and over. She didn’t know what to do if she found him, but all she wanted was to find the wounded old man.

*Am I wrong?* She didn’t know. *Is it better to believe in something that doesn’t exist or to silently overlook someone's delusions?* For herself, it was something she couldn’t accept. That’s why Gally wanted to tell Norinco the truth as well.

"...So, I ended up here, huh." After running through several alleyways, Gally found herself in a desolate wasteland, far from the structures of the city. She had reached the labyrinth of red ruins in the scrapyard. Looking back towards where she came from, she could just make out the silhouette of the floating city of Zalem, tinted red by the setting sun. This was the very edge of the small world known as The Scrapyard.

As Gally walked through the maze of tangled, decaying remnants of the previous century, she reflected on the old man, Norinco. It seemed that Norinco had subjected himself to abuse rather than merely being forced into it by his homelessness. He lived only to love and raise the imaginary daughter, Breda. When that entire illusion was shattered, he fled in despair, screaming.

"Am I... am I wrong?" Gally wondered. *The truth isn’t always something that brings happiness. If that’s the case, would my desire to know my true self, the part of me I lost, only bring me unhappiness?*

Norinco held the Breda doll tightly as she ran, exceeding the limits of her thin, worn-out cyborg legs with abnormal speed. 

"Ah, Norinco-san!" Gally stood frozen for a moment, shocked by Norinco's reaction, which was beyond her imagination. She didn’t want to know the truth. Perhaps it was better not to know. *Knowing the truth doesn’t necessarily bring happiness, does it?* Gally genuinely believed this, but the strange, bitter aftertaste left a knot in her chest, making her feel uneasy.

"Damn, where did she go?" Gally sprinted through the alleyways, chasing after the fleeing Norinco. She had already lost sight of the old woman. Even though Gally didn’t know what she would do once she caught up to Norinco, she just wanted to find the wounded old woman, no matter what.

*Am I wrong? Is it really okay to believe in something that isn't there, or to stay silent and ignore falsehoods?*
*...Could reclaiming the ancient martial art within herself also lead to a path of despair?*

"…Gally, Norinco is hiding ahead, in the shadows of the scrap heap, you know."

At that moment, while Gally was walking through the maze of debris, lost in thought, she suddenly heard a voice from somewhere. It was a voice she recognized.

"…Could it be… Calico? Calico, is that you? Where are you?"

As Gally looked around, searching, the woman appeared after a few moments.

“Gally, don’t sympathize with the enemy.”

“…Calico, your body…”

The figure that emerged from the shadow of the scrap pile was unmistakably Calico. However, her body no longer resembled her previous form at all. While her head remained that of the original Calico, from the neck down, her body had transformed into a strange, inhuman cyborg resembling the shape of a spider.

"Heh heh heh… don’t worry about it, Gally. A cybernetic doctor picked me up when I was on the verge of death."

"There's no doubt about it, that one's a serial killer," Calico declared, shaking her head slightly while addressing Gally from atop her spider-like body. "Gally, it’s unfortunate, but you’re the only one who can take them down. They’re terrifyingly strong, and unlike me, they have an uncanny ability to counter fighters who rely on complex combination attacks. They can read the combos, close in, and slowly dismantle their opponent’s limbs bit by bit. It’s like watching a mantis systematically tear the wings off its prey, piece by piece."

As Calico scuttled back into the scrapyard's heaps, she left Gally with one final instruction. "Your unconventional attacks that ignore the centerline give you a real chance. Please, avenge me and Sig. Take them down, Gally."

"Calico... I understand," Gally said, pressing her lips together firmly as she dashed through the maze of scrap. Ahead of her, just as Calico had described, loomed the ruins of an old factory, bathed in the fading light. "This is the place..." Gally muttered as she entered the ruins. The area was vast and open, with parts of the roof collapsed, and steel beams and pillars lay strewn about. The machinery had long since been removed, leaving the space eerily empty.

At her feet, she noticed the headless cyborg body of Norinco and the discarded clothing of the Breda doll. Gally tensed up, adopting a combat stance as she called out in a loud, clear voice that echoed through the dilapidated space.

"Norinco! Where are you hiding? I'll be your opponent—Gally!"

Her voice was soon met with a wheezing, rasping laugh. "Huhuhu... well now, are you just a little kid, maybe? Ain't it a bit too early for you to be facing me, little one?" The voice was far different from the elderly Norinco she had encountered during the day, dripping with a sinister confidence.

"Don't mock me!" Gally snapped back, her voice brimming with resolve. "I am a Hunter-Warrior!"

With that, she let out a sharp cry and kicked a nearby partially broken pillar. With just one blow, the pillar—a meter in diameter and reinforced with steel—shattered into pieces. "Oh, scary, scary. A kid like you is worth dismantling," Norinco taunted as he suddenly pounced from above Gally's head. The old man had been observing her from the steel beams of the ruins' roof.

"Ugh!" Gally narrowly dodged his attack, quickly taking some distance before readying her stance again.

"Did you kill the prostitutes and Shig all for that daughter of yours, Breda, who doesn't even exist?" Gally shouted, her words making Norinco's white hair tremble with anger. The sheer weight of his rising fury made her hesitate for a split second.

"You're... I see, you're that same girl who cornered me into despair earlier, aren't you? Gally, was it?" Norinco's body, now inside Breda's, ground his teeth as he glared at Gally with his radar eyes. With a shriek, he closed the distance in an instant, overwhelming Gally.

"Yes, you're right. Breda was never born. Breda was supposed to be the child my wife, Belchere, was going to give birth to," Norinco howled in response. He closed in on Gally with a strange, serpentine movement, his sharp hand strikes grazing her and steadily wearing away the outer layer of her combat body. He maintained a close distance, never allowing her an opening, like a coiled spring ready to strike.

"Fuu... shunuu... you... little... brat," Norinco muttered his last words before collapsing forward. A closer look revealed that his temple was crushed, with brain matter leaking from his ear. In mid-air, Gally had managed to dodge Norinco's hand blade using her advanced aerial control techniques. By hooking her leg onto his body, she spun around him, positioning herself behind him to strike his temple with her elbow.

The name of that move would later become known as **"Angel's Wing Hook"**, a technique that deeply etched itself into Gally's heart.

Gally approached the fallen Norinco, who lay face down, and gently lifted his body. "Bre... Bredda..." Norinco muttered weakly. He whispered in a barely audible voice, his trembling hand reaching out to touch Gally’s cheek as she held him. After a brief hesitation, she gently nuzzled her face against his in response.

“Thank you, Father... I’m glad I was born,” Gally said softly. At her words, Norinco gave a faint spasm before he stopped moving entirely. In silence, Gally stood up, leaving the rubble behind as the setting sun cast long shadows. By the time the blue dusk had fully settled, light rain began to fall as she stood on the street, staring at the soft glow from a familiar window—her home.

The lights on the first floor, where Ido’s clinic was, had long gone out, signaling the end of the day’s consultations. Only the second floor, Ido’s room, remained illuminated. Dragging her battered body, Gally made her way to the streetlamp where she could still see the house. There, she collapsed, sitting beneath the light, knees pulled close to her chest.

“Gally... is that you?”

Hearing the familiar voice, Gally, who had been resting her face against her knees in the misty rain, lifted her head with a start, her heart stirred. Ido stood there with a worried expression, almost like a dream. As Gally trembled and her lips quivered at the sight of him, her eyes filled with tears, and she clung to him.

Without saying a word, Ido picked up the sobbing Gally and carried her into a warm room, her body soaked.

### CHAPTER 10 (Continued)

Gally felt the warmth envelop her, a stark contrast to the cold, desolate ruins she had just left. Ido gently placed her on a nearby chair, his expression etched with concern.

"Are you alright, Gally?" he asked softly, his eyes scanning her battered form.

She nodded weakly, her breaths shallow. "Yeah... I'm fine."

Ido sighed, his earlier frustration now replaced with worry. "You look terrible. Maybe we should talk about what's been bothering you."

Gally hesitated, the weight of her recent confrontations pressing down on her. "It's just... I feel like I'm losing myself. Trying to prove I can be a great Hunter, but it's taking a toll on me."

Ido approached her, placing a comforting hand on her shoulder. "You're not alone in this. Remember why you started and what you stand for."

She looked up, meeting his eyes. "I know, but sometimes it feels like no matter how hard I try, it's never enough."

Ido's grip tightened slightly. "Don't give up, Gally. We both have our struggles, but we can overcome them together."

Gally managed a small smile, appreciating his support. "Thanks, Ido."

As the rain continued to fall outside, Gally felt a semblance of peace settle over her. Yet, deep within, the turmoil of her encounters with Norinco and the revelation of Breda's existence lingered, casting shadows over her newfound resolve.

---

### CHAPTER 10 (Final Section)

Later that night, as Gally lay in her room, the events of the day replayed in her mind. The confrontation with Norinco, the enigmatic Calico, and the unresolved mysteries surrounding Breda left her restless. Determined to uncover the truth, she knew she had to delve deeper into the secrets that haunted The Scrapyard.

The floating city of Zalem loomed in the distance, its red-tinted skyline a constant reminder of the fragile balance between hope and despair. Gally's new combat body felt both empowering and alien, a symbol of her relentless pursuit of strength and autonomy.

As she drifted into a troubled sleep, visions of shattered lives and lost dreams danced behind her closed eyes. The path ahead was fraught with danger and uncertainty, but Gally's resolve hardened. She would face whatever came her way, driven by the desire to avenge her fallen friends and to understand the true nature of her existence.

In the heart of The Scrapyard, where steel and shadows intertwined, Gally's journey continued—an odyssey of vengeance, redemption, and the search for identity in a world teetering on the brink of chaos.
