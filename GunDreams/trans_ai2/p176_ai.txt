"Are you still not done playing with your friends, Bredda?" Norinco asked, lifting his face from the doll's lap. In his blind eyes, it was as if Bredda was smiling clearly at him. 

"Alright, Bredda, I understand. Let's go find some more friends together. And we'll make sure to have plenty of fun with them," Norinco nodded repeatedly, standing up as he stripped off all his clothing. Then, he carefully undressed the doll he called Bredda, removing the mannequin head and placing it gently to the side. The old man opened the maintenance hatch of her body, and then his own. 

With practiced hands, Norinco began bypassing and connecting their internal systems, gradually sharing functions between himself and the Bredda doll. Finally, when he could no longer move his own body, he used the doll's arms to transfer his own head onto Bredda's body. 

Once the process was complete, Norinco's expression and demeanor had completely transformed into something that resembled an entirely different creature. 

"Hush... Bredda, I hope that nosy woman doesnâ€™t show up like last time. Well, she's probably at the bottom of the sewer river by now, staring up at the surface."
