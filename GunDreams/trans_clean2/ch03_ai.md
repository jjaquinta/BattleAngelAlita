# CHAPTER 3

Beneath the massive, ivory-colored pillar that supported the floating city of **Zalem**, the underside curved elegantly like a bell—beautiful, save for the grotesque, jagged tear at its tip, where waste spewed down to the earth below like foul, dirty blood. 

The trash rained continuously from Zalem, forming a towering heap over a thousand meters high at the center of **The Scrapyard**. Each new fall of debris sent distant tremors through the ground, accompanied by a low, ominous rumble.

Ido stood still, feeling the vibrations beneath his feet, eyes narrowing as the midday sun filtered through the dust-laden air. "It's past noon already," he muttered, using the distant rumble as a marker of time, as many in The Scrapyard did. The sound heralded the end of work for many—a time to pause, to reflect, and in some cases, to take a “half-day.”

He turned, his attention shifting back to the figure nearby.

“Hey, Alita, come over here,” Ido called out gently.

Alita, seated in a wheelchair, looked at him with slight hesitation. She had undergone a transformation in the days since they’d found her buried in the trash heaps—her body now equipped with cybernetic limbs, her frame restored to that of a young woman. It had taken time, but she was whole again, at least in form.

With newfound determination, she gripped the armrests of the chair and pushed herself up. 

"That's it, you can do it, Alita!" Ido encouraged, his fists clenched in anticipation. 

Her movements were slow at first, cautious, as she lowered one foot to the ground, as if testing the weight of the earth beneath her. Then, with a deep breath, she placed the other foot forward.

“I... Ido...”

Her voice trembled, reflecting a mixture of fear and resolve as she took her first, tentative steps toward him. Her movements were still awkward, but the sight of her walking again—alive, mobile—brought a wide smile to Ido’s face. Unable to contain his joy, he stepped forward and embraced her tightly.

"Ah, I’m so relieved. It looks like my body still remembers how to walk,” Alita said with a soft laugh. She looked up at Ido, eyes bright with the wonder of rediscovery. "Hey, Ido, does this mean I've finally become... a proper person?"

Ido’s expression softened. “Getting your body back together is just the beginning. You have to keep living from here on.”

“Keep living...” Alita echoed, her voice trailing off as she gazed out toward the sprawling scrapyard. Just a few weeks ago, she had been nothing more than forgotten debris, buried in a world that no longer remembered her existence. Now, she stood on her own two feet, but questions tugged at her, deep and insistent. Was this truly *her* life? Or was she merely an extension of Ido’s will, living because he had given her form?

As she pondered, a faint seed of doubt began to take root within her.

---

Later, in the quiet of Ido’s living room, Alita balanced a tray with a jug of water, walking over to where Gonzu was preparing to leave. 

"Are you leaving already?" she asked, watching as the older man—drunk and swaying—pulled himself from the table.

“Yeah, yeah, I’m off. If I drink any more, I’ll end up sleeping here,” Gonzu muttered with a chuckle, his wrinkled face flushed red from the alcohol.

Ido, seated nearby, stretched lazily. “You know you’re welcome to stay if you want,” he offered.

But Gonzu waved a hand dismissively. “Nah, you’re not the type who enjoys overnight company. I know that well enough.” He grinned and staggered out the door, leaving the room to Alita and Ido.

As the door clicked shut, Ido stood up with a yawn. "I’m tired today. I think I’ll turn in early.”

Alita tugged at the hem of his jacket, her eyes wide and pleading. “Are you really going to sleep already? Is the story about the outside world over for today?”

Ever since gaining her mobility, Alita had been eager to hear Ido’s stories—especially those about The Scrapyard and its hidden corners. Every little detail fascinated her, feeding her curiosity. But tonight, Ido shook his head.

“Sorry, not tonight. I’ve got a lot to handle right now. But in a few days, I’ll take you out to see the lively streets. For now, you should get some rest.”

Disappointed but resigned, Alita returned to her room as Ido disappeared down the hall.

*Closing my eyes and letting another day end… it feels so boring,* she thought, slipping beneath her covers.

---

Hours passed, but sleep eluded her. She lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, her mind racing with thoughts of the outside world. Finally, just as she was about to drift off, a noise stirred her from the edge of sleep.

Footsteps.

Faint, rhythmic, and growing distant. Alita’s eyes opened. In the moonlit room, she listened carefully, heart quickening. The footsteps were moving down the stairs. A few moments later, she heard the faint click of the clinic door opening, then closing softly.

Curiosity burning inside her, Alita slipped out of bed and crept to the window. She peered out through the curtains and saw a figure, dragging a large trunk, disappearing into the shadows of the street.

*Ido...?*

The spark of curiosity flared into a full-blown flame, and without another thought, Alita bolted from her room, racing into the night to follow him.

---

The pleasure district of **The Scrapyard** was a place of chaos. Under the garish glow of neon lights, the streets buzzed with activity, a sleepless hive of indulgence and vice. Here, everything was for sale—sex, drugs, violence—and the rules of the outside world held no sway.

Alita weaved through the crowd, overwhelmed by the sheer sensory overload. The flicker of holo-ads, the roar of cybernetic combat matches, the sickly scent of burning narcotics—it all assaulted her at once.

"Where are you, Ido?" she muttered, her small frame nearly swallowed by the throng of people. She kept her eyes on his black, Adamski-style hat, bobbing just ahead of her through the sea of bodies.

Suddenly, Ido slipped into a narrow alley. Alita hurried after him, pushing through the press of the crowd—until she slammed into something hard.

"Well, well, seems like Baby’s hammerhead is pretty tough!" 

Alita staggered backward, stunned. Before her stood a towering full-body cyborg with the head of a steel bull. He grinned down at her, flexing his massive arms. 

"S-sorry," Alita stammered, trying to step around him, but the bull-headed cyborg blocked her path, deliberately thrusting his chest forward.

"Sorry doesn’t cut it, little girl!" He sneered, his voice booming. “What should I do with you now?”

Alita backed away, her heart pounding. *Someone… please help…*

But the crowd merely watched, amused or indifferent. No one stepped in to aid her.

The bull-headed cyborg raised his fist, a grin splitting his face. "Time to teach you a lesson, baby!"

---

"Uwaaaahhh!" 

Alita ducked just as the cyborg’s massive fist whizzed past her head, slamming into the ground with a crack. Without thinking, she rolled through the narrow space under his arm and dashed into the crowd, slipping away before he could react.

“F***! That baby got away!” the bull-headed cyborg snarled, turning to pursue her.

---

Alita’s heart raced as she ran, weaving through the crowd until she heard a soft voice call out to her.

“Over here, sweetie.”

She turned and saw a plump woman standing in the shadows of a narrow alley. The woman waved her over with a smile, her face thick with makeup.

“You’ll be safe here for a while,” the woman said as Alita hesitated. She gently took Alita’s hand and led her into the dim, garbage-strewn alley. “My name’s Shigu. What’s yours?”

“Alita,” she replied cautiously.

Shigu leaned against the wall, her gaze shifting as if calculating something. “A girl like you wandering around here at night? You’re bound to run into trouble.”

"I lost sight of Ido... and that guy with the bull head..." Alita clenched her fists in frustration. "I didn’t know what was going on, and I panicked... damn it!"

Shigu laughed softly, but there was something sharp in her eyes, something dangerous.

Before Alita could react, several more women appeared from the shadows, surrounding her. Shigu’s tone grew cold.

“You’re too kind, Alita. I didn’t save you for free. Now, it’s time to accept your fate.” 

One of the women shoved Alita against the wall, pressing a knife to her throat.

"What are you doing?!" Alita gasped.

The women rolled up her sleeves, examining her cybernetic limbs. “Shigu, no doubt about it. These

 are parts from the missing Stea.”

“And her legs... from that killer Walza.”

Shigu’s eyes narrowed. “Those limbs of yours, girl... they belonged to our sisters. Where did you get them?”

---

Alita’s heart raced as the bloodlust in the alley rose to a fever pitch. The women brandished knives, their eyes burning with anger.

"You’ve got the arms and legs of our dead sisters, girl. We’ll make you pay for it—and that bastard Ido too!"

"No! Ido would never—he’s not a killer!" Alita cried, her breath quickening as the knife in Shigu’s hand gleamed in the dim light.

“It’s too late for excuses, little girl,” Shigu sneered, raising the blade. “Time to die.”

Alita’s mind screamed, a wild, instinctive fear flooding her senses. 

"I... I don’t want to die!"

Something inside her snapped—a deep, primal force surging to the surface. With a sharp cry, Alita’s body moved on its own, her fists catching the knife mid-swing. The blade shattered, scattering shards of steel across the alley.

---

The women froze in shock. Shigu staggered back, her face twisted with terror as she collapsed onto the filthy ground, her legs giving out beneath her. 

The other women, wide-eyed with fear, dropped their knives and fled into the shadows, leaving Alita standing alone in the alley, trembling.

*What... what is this feeling?*

Her body hummed with unfamiliar energy, a surge of violent instincts rising within her. Memories—fragmented and hazy—flickered at the edge of her consciousness, remnants of a past she couldn’t fully recall.

But before she could regain her composure, a voice interrupted the stillness.

---

"That was impressive, little lady."

Alita spun around, her heart leaping into her throat. From the shadows, a tall figure stepped forward—a woman with sharp, red hair and a cold, calculating gaze. She wore a sleek leather coat, her body clearly that of a full-body cyborg like Alita.

“Who... who are you?” Alita demanded, her body still tense, ready to fight.

The red-haired woman grinned. “I was hired to find a certain serial killer. But now I’ve found something even more interesting...”

The two women stood locked in a moment of quiet, mutual recognition. Alita, trembling, narrowed her eyes, her fists clenching.

“I won’t let you hurt Ido!” she shouted, charging toward the red-haired woman with all the force she could muster.

But in an instant, the red-haired woman dodged, countering with a swift kick that sent Alita flying into the wall. 

Alita hit the ground hard, dazed, her vision blurring as the woman approached her.

"You mentioned Ido, huh?" the redhead said, her voice curious. “Is he your father or something?”

“No... he’s my savior,” Alita whispered, her consciousness slipping away as the woman loomed over her, her figure cast in shadow.

*Ido... please don’t get caught by this woman...*

And then, everything went black.
