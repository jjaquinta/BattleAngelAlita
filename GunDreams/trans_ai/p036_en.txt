As Ido read the data being displayed one after another, a look of clear astonishment began to spread across his face.

"I knew it... I can’t believe such a preservation method exists in reality."

Ido trembled at the discovery.

The girl's brain, still inside her skull, had been preserved in a frozen state. It could only be described as a form of "room temperature cold sleep." The brain, which had been on the verge of decay, had, to his amazement, been frozen and plastinated while still alive. This process had completely halted its activity. Yet, it was astonishing that even after hundreds of years, the brain's tissue had remained intact.

There was no doubt that someone had applied this specialized plastination preservation technique to the girl's brain. Someone must have performed this procedure and then discarded the girl, hiding her among the waste. Ido broadly speculated this, though he couldn’t be certain. However, he was convinced that he wasn’t far from the truth.
