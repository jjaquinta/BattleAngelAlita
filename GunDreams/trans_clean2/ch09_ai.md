### CHAPTER 9

A cloudless night enveloped the sprawling outskirts of The Scrapyard, where a desolate ruin stood as a testament to forgotten industry. Once a bustling waste processing plant, the structure now served solely as the refuge of a homeless old man. Through a gaping hole in the crumbling wall, orange flames flickered, casting dancing shadows across the dilapidated interior. Norinco, the old man who had been seen earlier that day, sat hunched by the fire, clutching his head in despair.

"Breda, in my foolishness..." he groaned, his body writhing in agony. His silhouette, gaunt and hunched, wavered against the wall, illuminated intermittently by the flickering flames. "Please, forgive me," he pleaded. Though his eyes had long since succumbed to blindness, the final image they had captured remained vivid in his mind—an unrelenting vision that tormented him daily with guilt and regret. Despite his blindness, a faint glimmer of light seemed to linger in his eyes, and his black hair flowed wildly around him like a mane.

Suddenly, the silence shattered with shouts. "Kyahhh!" "Hiiiii, it's... a Hunter!"

The underground chamber had long been the hideout of the Spine Robbery Gang. After three relentless months of tracking, Norinco had finally discovered their lair. Kicking open the door, he surged into the room, his wild black hair flowing as he launched himself at the gang like an agile predator. Even armed and cybernetically enhanced, the bounty heads were caught off guard, falling helplessly before his lethal "Mantis Kung Fu." Sliding into a low stance, his swift hand strikes sent them sinking into pools of blood and flesh.

In less than five minutes, the dozen bounty heads lay cold on the floor, the air thick with the acrid stench of blood. Norinco, drenched in the macabre scene, flashed a fierce smile as he walked past the corpses. "Heh heh, with these many bounties, I should be able to pay off some of my debts and even buy some children's clothes," he thought, eyes gleaming with anticipation for the birth of his long-desired child.

The tender image of parenthood had always been a distant dream for him—a stark contrast to his harsh reality as a young orphan who never knew his parents. An accident at ten had left him with a fully cybernetic body, severing his reproductive capabilities. Driven by an insatiable yearning for connection, Norinco had invested 50 million chips into a groundbreaking fertilization procedure for his wife.

This cutting-edge procedure extracted DNA from brain cells and fused it with that of an egg, creating not a clone, but a true descendant bearing the genetic legacy of both parents. As Norinco prepared to leave the hellish chamber, his waist and hands still heavy with the bodies of his fallen foes, a heavy thud echoed from behind him. Turning, he spotted a boy, no more than ten, hiding behind a pillar. The boy had dropped the knife he had been clutching.

Norinco, still holding severed heads in both hands, approached the trembling child with a calm yet menacing tone. "What's wrong? If you don't hurry, I'll hunt you down too."

"D-Damn it... You killed my dad!" The boy, tears of fear and anger streaming down his face, attempted to lift the too-heavy knife, his small hands trembling. Norinco effortlessly kicked the weapon away. "I'm in a good mood today. I'm not so bored that I'd hunt down a child who isn't even a bounty."

In a harsher, commanding voice, Norinco added, "Kid, if you don't want to die, get lost!"

The boy shuddered, seemingly struck by an electric shock, and fled at full speed.

*Did my parents disappear in front of me like that, too?* Norinco wondered. *Will that boy, like me, carry an insatiable hunger for his lost family for the rest of his life?*

Sighing, Norinco shook his head, dismissing any trace of pity for the child. Normally, he would have eliminated the boy without hesitation, but now, he found himself feeling an unexpected sentimentality toward children. Stepping out of the basement, he felt something cold gently fall on his forehead. "Oh, snow... when did it start?" The pure white crystals, born from the darkness, made a faint *sff* sound as they began to accumulate on the dimly lit street. "I'm coming home, darling..." Leaving footprints in the snow, Norinco hurried down the street and vanished into the night.

His child—had they been born yet?

In a rundown apartment tucked away in a back alley, far from the bustling main streets, lay Norinco's home. Bursting into the room with an armful of bounty heads, he eagerly asked his wife lying on the bed, "Has the baby been born, Belchere? Is our child here yet?"

"No, not yet, dear. But it will be soon. This little one keeps kicking, eager to meet their father," Belchere replied, gently stroking her growing belly and letting out a soft sigh. Norinco placed the bounty heads on the table and cautiously approached the bed, softly touching his wife's swollen abdomen.

"Oh, oh... it's moving. The child inside you is the only thing that gives my life meaning. In this city, where dreams and hope are nonexistent, all I've ever wished for is to raise our child. That wish will soon come true. Thank you."

Belchere placed her hand over Norinco's steel one on her belly, shaking her head slightly. "I'm the one who should be thanking you, Norinco. You took in someone like me—just another woman leading a miserable life—and have treated me with such care, making me feel special."

Norinco's expression clouded, and he averted his eyes. "No... I'm not a man worthy of your gratitude. To be honest, any woman who could bear my child would have sufficed for me. And for that, I'm truly sorry."

Belchere's smile remained radiant, undeterred by his hesitant words. She sat up halfway in bed and gently wrapped her arms around his back, pulling him close. "That’s perfectly fine with me. I never imagined I could find any meaning in life during those days of hardship. But you gave me the precious duty of bringing a child into this world. That alone makes me incredibly happy now. ...Norinco, I’m truly glad to be alive."

Norinco, in turn, embraced her, his arms wrapping around her back. Raising his face, he offered a rare smile. "Belchere, I will always take pride in the fact that I am having a child with you."

Slowly stepping away from the bed, Norinco grabbed the bounty heads neatly lined up on the table. "For the sake of our child, who will likely be born tomorrow, I need to turn these bounty heads into chips. I have to hire the doctor and midwives first thing in the morning."

"By the time you return, make sure to wash your face, so you don’t scare the baby," Belchere added with a soft smile. It was only then that Norinco realized his body was still covered in dried blood, giving him a dark, mottled appearance. Shrugging lightly, he left the room.

After walking for about thirty minutes, Norinco arrived at the Factory. He handed over all the bounty heads to Deckman, the human interface inside the Factory, and exchanged them for chips.

"One hundred and ten thousand chips, huh... not bad," Norinco muttered to himself as he walked through the snow-covered alley, jingling the chips in his pocket. Even after paying off his debts, he would have forty thousand chips left.

Instead of heading straight home, Norinco decided to make a slight detour. "Might as well celebrate the birth of my child a little early," he thought as he stepped through the door of his usual bar on the main street. By adjusting the alcohol decomposition function, even a cyborg could enjoy a drink.

For about an hour, he quietly drank alone, contemplating names for his unborn child, wondering if it would be a boy or a girl. Later, slightly unsteady from drinking, Norinco wandered into an alley, his apartment just a ten-minute walk away. As snowflakes fell gently onto his heated face, he felt a refreshing coolness and walked slowly, gazing up at the night sky.

After about five minutes of walking through the back alleys in a dreamy state, Norinco suddenly caught a whiff of something burning. "What's this smell...?" he muttered suspiciously, wrinkling his brow and sniffing the air. Something was definitely burning nearby.

"Outta the way!"

Just as Norinco was trying to pinpoint the source of the smell, a child burst from the corner of the alley, running frantically. The child collided with Norinco and fell hard but got back up without so much as a glance before taking off at full speed again, disappearing toward the main street.

"What the... What the hell is going on?" Norinco mumbled, his drunken speech slurred, shaking his head in confusion. As he gathered his thoughts, he realized something familiar about the child who had just bumped into him.

"Wait a minute... that kid... Could it be?"

"Dammit, you killed my father!"

The image of the boy he had spared earlier that night flashed vividly in Norinco's mind. The appearance, the presence, the voice—all matched perfectly with the boy he had encountered just an hour ago. His mind suddenly cleared from the fog of alcohol, and Norinco clenched his teeth, glaring into the dark alley that reeked of burning.

The faint smell from before had now grown stronger, filled with a sharp, acrid stench that stung his nose.

"No... It can't be. No way!"

A terrible premonition welled up inside him, making him feel nauseous. Without hesitation, Norinco started running down the snowy alley, driven by an overwhelming sense of dread. "My child... my child!" he screamed as he sprinted through the alley, only to be greeted by a scene of utter devastation. His dilapidated apartment was engulfed in raging flames, spewing fire into the night sky.

"Nooooooo!" He let out a feral roar as he ran toward the burning building, ignoring the flames licking at the entrance.

"Hey, that's crazy!" "It's already too late!" Some onlookers shouted as they watched the inferno, but by the time they spoke, Norinco had already charged into the fire, disappearing from view.

"I’ll save you, my child!" he cried, ignoring the searing heat that began to scorch his body. With swift movements, he darted up the crumbling staircase, reaching the third floor where his room was. The hallway on that floor was engulfed in the fiercest flames.

There was no doubt in his mind—the boy he had spared had set this fire, targeting him. It was clear that a large amount of oil had been used to meticulously set the blaze. The flames raged inside like the furnace of a crematorium, consuming the building.

With a wild, animalistic shriek, Norinco hurled himself into the inferno, plunging into the intense heat. He powered up his cyborg body to its maximum and smashed through the wall of the room.

"My child!!!" he screamed, but it was in vain. The room where Belchere had been was already ravaged by the same flames that consumed the hallway. Still burning from the fire clinging to his clothes, Norinco stepped into the room and was met with the horrific sight of his wife's charred corpse.

She had tried to protect their unborn child until her final moments, collapsing on the floor, curled around her belly. While her back and head were severely burned, the abdomen where their child lay remained untouched, almost as if it were still alive.

"Belchere... I'm so sorry. My child, please forgive me," Norinco wailed. "I made enemies with the wrong people, and now... this." "If only I hadn't stopped to drink... If I had just gone home, you both wouldn't have had to suffer such a horrible death..."

Engulfed in flames and consumed by grief, Norinco reached up to his own eyes and gouged them out. "This pain, this suffering... it's nothing compared to what you went through!"

Blood poured from the hollow sockets where his eyes had been as he cradled Belchere's charred corpse. Holding her tightly, he leapt from the burning building, falling from a height of about ten meters and landing with a heavy thud, his feet sinking into the snow-covered alleyway.

Norinco let out a primal scream into the snowy night sky, a cry filled with rage and sorrow. With everything lost to the flames—his unborn child and his beloved wife—he stumbled down the alley, disappearing like a shadow into the snowfall.

More than fifty years had passed since that fateful day, time moving on relentlessly before Norinco. Now, his white hair disheveled, he shed tears from his blind eyes, writhing in agony. "Forgive me. Please, forgive me," he repeated in his heart, clawing at his head as if to silence the flames of the campfire that illuminated him.

"Norinco... Norinco... Lift your head."

Amidst his groaning, a voice echoed in his mind. "Norinco, don’t blame yourself too much..."

"Bredda... It’s you, Bredda, isn't it? Oh, my beloved Bredda, my miraculous child... Are you here to comfort this sinful heap of flesh?"

Crying, Norinco crawled toward the doll of the young girl propped up on the chair and clung to her knees. The doll's face, illuminated by the flickering flames, seemed to change expressions as if it were alive.

"You are so kind. Whenever I feel lonely, you always take me to visit my friends..."

"Oh, oh... I'll always take you to visit your friends so you won’t ever be lonely..." "Are you still not done playing with your friends, Bredda?" Norinco asked, lifting his face from the doll's lap. In his blind eyes, it was as if Bredda was smiling clearly at him.

"Alright, Bredda, I understand. Let's go find some more friends together. And we'll make sure to have plenty of fun with them," Norinco nodded repeatedly, standing up as he stripped off all his clothing. Then, he carefully undressed the doll he called Bredda, removing the mannequin head and placing it gently to the side. The old man opened the maintenance hatch of her body, and then his own.

With practiced hands, Norinco began bypassing and connecting their internal systems, gradually sharing functions between himself and the Bredda doll. Finally, when he could no longer move his own body, he used the doll's arms to transfer his own head onto Bredda's body.

Once the process was complete, Norinco's expression and demeanor had completely transformed into something that resembled an entirely different creature.

"Hush... Bredda, I hope that nosy woman doesn’t show up like last time. Well, she's probably at the bottom of the sewer river by now, staring up at the surface." Covered in white hair entangled around his body, Norinco, now inside Bredda’s body, wheezed and strapped a long, deadly knife to his waist before leaving the ruins and heading into the night town. He was out once again to hunt fresh prey to offer Bredda tonight.
