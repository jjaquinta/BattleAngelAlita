"Those arms and legs of yours... they're all from our fellow prostitutes who either died or went missing. Gally, where and how did you get those limbs?"

"When you say where, my whole body was fixed by Ido!" Gally replied, to which Shigu and the others repeated the name "Ido" in unison. Their voices were filled with deep anger.

"So it was that Ido guy who cut up Stea?"

"And Walza too."

"Uji was also killed..."

Overwhelmed by the rising bloodlust of the prostitutes, Gally felt a dull numbness creep into her head. 

What are these people even saying?

"There's been a serial killer prowling around here lately. Us prostitutes have been hit the hardest, losing many of our sisters to that murderer. We were just about to figure out how to deal with the bastard, and then you show up wearing parts from one of our victims."
