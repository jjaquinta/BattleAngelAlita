It was clear that a large amount of oil had been used to meticulously set the fire. The flames raged inside like the furnace of a crematorium, consuming the building. 

With a wild, animalistic shriek, Norinco hurled himself into the inferno, plunging into the intense heat. He powered up his cyborg body to its maximum and smashed through the wall of the room. 

"My child!!!" he screamed, but it was in vain. The room where Belchea had been was already ravaged by the same flames that consumed the hallway. Still burning from the fire clinging to his clothes, Norinco stepped into the room and was met with the horrific sight of his wife's charred corpse. 

It was clear that she had tried to protect their unborn child until her final moments. She had collapsed on the floor, curled around her belly. While her back and head had been severely burned, the abdomen where their child lay was untouched, almost as if it were still alive. 

"Belchea... I'm so sorry. My child, please forgive me," Norinco wailed. "I made enemies with the wrong people, and now... this."
