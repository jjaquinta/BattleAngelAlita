"I must thank God. When I bumped into you back then and became obsessed with you, I must have already sensed this moment," Colt said, raising his bull-like head high and sighing.

Then, facing Gally, who stood naturally, he readied his fists.

"Fuuuuu-gaaaah!"

With a fierce shout, Colt stepped in with his right foot and unleashed a lethal double-arm thrust with all his might.

Gally let out a sharp breath, kicked upward from below, and launched a vertical fist. Without resisting the upward momentum, she placed her hands on the ground as if performing a cartwheel, spinning both legs like a tornado to kick Colt.

With that single blow, Colt's fully extended right arm was shattered from the shoulder and blown several meters away, spinning and rolling on the street.

"Ugh! How does a baby like you have such destructive power!"

While trembling in fear, Colt simultaneously felt his brain numb with an intense joy and madness that would have made him ejaculate if he were human.

"This is it, baby! Is this moment the final destination of desire in my runaway express life?"
