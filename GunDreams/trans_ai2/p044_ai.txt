The moonlight, which had been hidden by clouds until now, began to faintly illuminate the alley, revealing the face of the man dressed in black who had stopped. It was Ido Daisuke. Ido knelt down and quietly opened the trunk, pulling out a disassembled war hammer. The head of the hammer was sharply pointed, and when fully assembled, its handle was about one and a half meters long. This hammer was not a tool for driving stakes; it was a weapon, known as a "war hammer," designed to destroy enemies.

Ido silently gripped the weapon with both hands and pressed himself against the wall, holding his breath. One minute passed... then another... Ido blended into the shadows of the alley, waiting. After a while, footsteps could be heard approaching from the depths of the alley. 

"Heh, they're here," Ido muttered, his lips curling into a defiant grin. The only thing bright on him, his white gloves, tightened around the hammer's grip with a faint squeak. The footsteps grew closer and closer as the figures finally approached the crossroads where Ido lay in wait.
