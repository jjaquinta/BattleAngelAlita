"Please... please forgive me," pleaded the old man.  
"Shut up, you filthy old geezer! This ain’t a place for stinking scum like you, got it?" snarled one of the thugs.  
"Yeah, finish him off, finish him!" squealed one of the women egging them on.  
"He's so annoying! Just kill the old man already!"  

Gally, a bit intrigued by the commotion, glanced over. She saw a gang of lowlifes and a few obnoxious women surrounding a homeless old man, mercilessly beating him. It seemed the old man had begged for some change, which led the women to call for the thugs' help. Excited by the attention from the women, the thug, his face flushed with excitement, kept kicking the old man, who repeatedly begged for mercy while laughing cruelly.

"Hey, that's enough. Cut it out," Gally said as she casually stepped into the middle of the beating. She helped the battered old man up. As she got a closer look, she realized it was someone she had met before—the blind old man, Norinco, who had tried to sell scraps to Bergman's shop only to be chased away.
