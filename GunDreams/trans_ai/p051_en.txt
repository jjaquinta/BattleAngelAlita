Gally naturally carried a tray with a water jug, walking and standing up from the table in the living room.

"Oh, Gonzo, are you leaving already?"
Gonzo, heavily drunk and staggering, nodded with his wrinkled, flushed face.

"Hehe, I know you don't like that kind of stuff. Don't worry about it."
"Yeah, if I drink any more here, I'll end up staying the night. I'll continue at my apartment."

"I don't mind, Gonzo,"
Ido, who had been lightly accompanying Gonzo, leaned on the table and shook his head.
Gonzo laughed and left. After seeing him off, Ido returned to the living room, stretching and yawning widely.
