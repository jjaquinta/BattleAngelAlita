"You don't know? I mean the cyborg body doll sitting in the front seat of this cart. Isn't that yours, old man?"

"Ahh... Br-... Breda, Breda!!" The old man panicked, shaking his white hair wildly as Gally pressed him further. Stumbling around to the front of the cart, he reached out and carefully pulled the doll seated there towards him, holding it tightly in both arms. "Shushu... Breda, Breda... Oh, I told you, didn’t I? You shouldn’t talk to strangers! It’ll be too late if something happens to you... You’re such a delicate girl..."

Seeing the old man’s frantic behavior, Gally stood there with her mouth slightly open, unable to comprehend the situation. Bergman gently tapped her on the shoulder and shook his head slightly. The old man had already forgotten everything else, his mind entirely consumed by the doll he called Breda.

"Let’s go home, Breda... I know you must be a little hungry, but forgive me, alright?" The old man muttered as he slowly pulled the old cart, disappearing down the street.

"Wait, the body might be impressive, but the head is just a doll, right?" Gally asked, still puzzled.

"Yeah, Gally, that’s just a regular doll. The old man lost his mind a long time ago," Bergman responded, sighing.
