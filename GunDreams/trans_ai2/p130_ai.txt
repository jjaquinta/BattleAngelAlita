Calico delivered a decisive kick. If this didn’t end it, she would lose. Throwing her entire body into the attack, her thigh shot upwards like a knee strike, and her lower leg, folded at the knee, unfolded with a sharp downward angle. At the same time, the red-hot thermal blade stored in her calf sprang out like a jackknife, aimed directly at Norinco’s exposed skull.

The speed of the kick, the angle, the timing, and the power—everything about this strike was flawless. It was one of the best executions of Calico's "Red Heat Leg" in her lifetime. 

A dull metallic sound rang out once, echoing off the walls. For a moment, only the heavy rain, the thunder, and the sound of the now-turbulent sewage river filled the space.

"...Impossible," Calico muttered, breaking the silence. Then, low and raspy gasps came from Norinco, mixed with the acrid smell of something burning, followed by his eerie, wheezing laughter.
