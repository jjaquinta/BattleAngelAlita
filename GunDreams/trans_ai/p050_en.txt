"Ah, I'm glad. It seems like my brain still remembers how to walk. Hey, Ido, does this mean my body is finally complete now?"
Gally says this while staring at Ido's face. Just a few weeks ago, she was nothing more than a buried piece of scrap, but now she stands in front of Ido, smiling with the joy of walking.
"Your body has returned to normal, so from now on, you have to live your life."
"Living on...? Yes, that's right."
Gally repeated Ido's words as if savoring them.
The current Gally might be alive because of Ido. If Ido hadn't picked her up, Gally's life wouldn't have existed.
However, Gally couldn't tell if that was truly her own life.
A vague question grew within Caliâ€™s heart as she gained freedom over her body.
From now on, Gally had to seek the meaning of living.
