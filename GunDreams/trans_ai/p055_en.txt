It was a sleepless city regulated by the norm.
Sex, violence, drugs, fraud—all of it was seen, and even the prostitutes laughed as they watched. Near homeless people warming themselves by a fire in a drum, others stood gazing as though their souls had been torn out after being torn limb from limb. On the monitor, a cyborg prostitute was displayed suddenly experiencing a bad trip from a cocktail of drugs, collapsing with a scream, while excited onlookers started fighting and brawling on the roadside.
One of the prostitutes who had witnessed the whole scene just shrugged without doing anything. The others quickly carried her off somewhere.
In such circumstances, passersby didn’t seem to care, simply walking by.
For the first time, Gally was hit by the overwhelming stimuli of the vivid colors in this entertainment district, her brain tingling and feeling dizzy. If she stayed any longer, she felt she might pass out.
