### CHAPTER 7

A tapestry of humans and cyborgs moved through the vibrant chaos, setting up stalls, peddling goods, eating, drinking, scavenging, getting drunk, passing out, sitting, and even succumbing to death. Amidst the dazzling neon lights flickering in the night along the main street of the eastern district of The Scrapyard, Gally navigated the crowd with unbridled joy. Recently, Ido had been consumed by daytime clinic appointments, allowing Gally to slip into the nocturnal cityscape unnoticed. On nights when she planned her escapades, a smile of excitement and thrill played on her lips as she deftly avoided detection by Ido, who remained oblivious until he retreated to his bedroom.

It had been three weeks since her inaugural solo venture into the night, during the incident that marked her first trial as a Hunter-Warrior against Colt. The outcome of that confrontation became clear only after she awoke on the maintenance bed the following day, listening to Ido's recount of the events. Though Gally had fought, the details of the battle eluded her memory, save for the lingering recollection of the technique she had employed. Each solitary night became an opportunity to test her strength against streetlights or abandoned objects in deserted alleys.

“Gally, don’t hunt bounty heads you’re unfamiliar with. You’re still an inexperienced Hunter,” Ido had cautioned her sternly. He had made it clear that he wouldn’t permit her to undertake Hunter missions without his accompaniment. Even now, Ido harbored reservations about Gally’s role as a Hunter-Warrior. He feared she might sustain serious injuries, become disillusioned by the city’s rampant crime and moral decay, or adopt violent tendencies and bad habits. His primary concern stemmed from his profound care for Gally, who had become an indispensable member of his family.

Consequently, Ido had recently begun to sigh heavily whenever he saw Gally, while she, seemingly unaware, remained carefree. “I’m much stronger than Ido thinks. He doesn’t trust me enough,” Gally muttered to herself, leaning against a streetlamp that bathed the night streets in its glow. She pressed her thick lips together in mild frustration, her expression a mix of determination and dissatisfaction. Gally failed to grasp that Ido’s worries were not a reflection of her strength or trustworthiness. Her straightforward nature led her to simplify complex emotions, understanding only that “being strong means there’s nothing to worry about,” while struggling to comprehend the nuanced truth that “even if you’re strong, that doesn’t prevent someone from worrying.”

Crouched beneath the streetlight, Gally observed the ebb and flow of passersby. With merely three months of memories, everything remained fresh and exhilarating, including the simple act of watching people traverse the city. There were nights when she became so engrossed in the endless stream of humanity that she failed to notice the dawn creeping over the horizon.

"Hmm? Who’s that?" she murmured, her attention snagged by a group moving nearby. Gally retrieved a crumpled piece of paper from her pocket, glancing between it and the passing figures, comparing them intently. Her eyes sparkled with recognition as she stood, eagerly trailing them into the crowd. The crumpled paper was a printed bounty list she had acquired two days earlier by accessing the interface of a Factory security information management robot, "Netman," on the street. *Ido, tonight I’ll go out on my own again, without telling you, and prove myself as a capable Hunter-Warrior. Soon, you’ll see I can handle everything on my own,* she thought resolutely.

“Sixty thousand, seventy-six thousand, eighty-one thousand...” Gally mumbled the bounty amounts as she pushed through the throng. The three bounties she had identified were valued at 60,000 chips, 76,000 chips, and 81,000 chips, respectively. For Gally, still reliant on Ido’s support, these sums held little financial significance. However, the bounty values provided a tangible measure of the criminals' danger, making them easier to remember than mere names.

As Gally pursued the trio through the bustling street, contemplating the optimal moment and place to strike, they abruptly vanished into one of the small shops lining the avenue. “Oh no, I lost them,” she muttered, swept along by the crowd like a leaf in the wind. After a brief struggle, she finally reached the front of the shop. Gally bent over, resting her hands on her knees, taking a deep breath before lifting her gaze to the shop’s sign. The name "Gamma Ray" emblazoned above the entrance was peculiar. *If I enter, they won’t be able to escape, but a fight could ensue inside...* Gally realized that stepping into the bar would make her presence immediately noticeable, complicating her pursuit of the two remaining targets. Worse, she might be thrust into a brawl amidst other patrons.

As a novice Hunter-Warrior, it was ideal to lure her targets into an open space where she could engage them without concern for bystanders. However, this would require her to wait outside patiently for them to exit the bar, an impractical option given her need to return home before dawn.

*“Ugh... hmm... ah, whatever!”* After pacing in front of the bar entrance with a frustrated frown, Gally finally shook her head decisively and grabbed the door handle.

Just as she turned the old knob and pulled the door open, a loud crash erupted from within. The door burst inward with a scream, as if violently torn from its hinges. Several women, terrified, fled into the street, one collapsing from a deep cut across her back before reaching the safety of the crowd. Gally, standing at the entrance, quietly closed the door behind her with a soft "click" that seemed to amplify over the faint melody of an old record playing inside the dimly lit bar.

Inside, not a single table or chair remained intact—most had been smashed or toppled, strewn in disarray across the floor. Among the wreckage lay the lifeless bodies of several unlucky patrons who hadn’t escaped in time. Gally felt a shiver run through her body as she took in the scene of destruction. *Am I trembling?* she wondered. *What am I scared of? Get a grip.* She repeated these words mentally, striving to calm her body, which had grown tense with apprehension. Taking a silent, deep breath, she endeavored to remain unnoticed.

The three bounty targets who had rampaged through the bar, leaving devastation in their wake, remained oblivious to Gally’s presence. A man leaning against the wall, his arms and legs cybernetically enhanced and worth a bounty of 60,000 chips, held a bloodstained curved blade in one hand. His unfocused eyes stared blankly into space after taking a hit of synthetic drugs. The second man, valued at 76,000 chips, fully cybernetic and clad in a black coat, sat calmly at the counter, pouring himself a glass of bourbon, his demeanor incongruent with the brutal scene surrounding him. The third, a black woman, also fully cybernetic and worth 81,000 chips, rifled through the bar’s storage, gleefully counting the stolen cash she had extracted from the safe.

"What a vile thing to do," Gally muttered under her breath. She spoke aloud to the trio, her voice cutting through the heavy air. "Closing time, you bastards."

The man worth 76,000 chips, casually sipping whiskey, responded without turning to face her. "So what? That just means there's no one left to get in our way."

Gally steadied her voice, though a slight tremble betrayed her inner turmoil. Until now, the three bounty heads had barely acknowledged her presence. Her provocation changed that. In an instant, all three turned their hostile glares toward her, their malice electrifying the dimly lit bar.

Surrounded by their deadly intent, Gally felt a tremor ripple through her once more.

"Hah! Heh heh, look at this little kitten here, talking tough," sneered the man worth 60,000 chips, leaning against the wall with his broad curved blade. His drug-fueled body swayed as he laughed mockingly. "She’s shaking... She’s scared stiff, huh?"

The man approached Gally with an unsteady gait, his sneer widening as he drew closer. Still a bit scared, she thought, *Do I still not trust myself? Damn it, I’m strong enough. I beat that Colt guy, didn’t I?* Gally tried to dispel her hesitation, mentally urging herself on, but Ido's voice echoed in her mind. "Gally, you're still less than half a Hunter..."

"Damn it! Don’t underestimate me! I’m a Hunter!" Gally shouted, sharply exhaling as she forced her fear aside. She darted forward, weaving around tables and bodies as she charged at the man worth 60,000 chips, who staggered drunkenly.

"Ha ha ha! A Hunter, you say? This little girl?!" the man slurred, his voice dripping with mockery. Though clearly high and unsteady, his anger flared as Gally swiftly closed the distance. With a powerful swing of his curved blade, powered by his cyborg arm, he slashed at her.

Gally ducked under the sweeping blade, lowering her head to avoid the strike, then planted her right hand on the floor as she kicked her left leg upward. Using her hand as a pivot, Gally twisted her body, executing a cartwheel-like motion. Her heel arced from below in a sweeping motion, targeting the man’s temple from his blind spot. The impact echoed through the room with the sound of shattering bones, sending the head of the 60,000-chip man flying through the air.

"Two more to go!" Gally shouted as she spun across the floor, ready for her next target. The man worth 76,000 chips, momentarily stunned by her unexpected combat prowess, stood from the counter, baring his teeth before spitting in fury.

"You brat! Damn you!" he snarled, flinging open his black coat. Inside, it was lined with throwing knives, shimmering like silver scales. With practiced ease, he grabbed four in each hand, eight in total. "Take this!" he roared, hurling the knives with speed and precision, aiming directly at Gally as she closed the distance.

Sensing the danger, Gally swiftly dodged to the side, causing the knives to miss their mark and pierce the floor instead, creating a honeycomb of holes. She rolled to the side and used a fallen round table as cover, halting her movement to conceal herself behind it.

"My knives have been underestimated, huh? You think a flimsy wooden shield will stop me?!" The man, utilizing the full power of his cyborg arm, hurled his knives with such force that they could easily pierce through two and a half centimeters of steel. With a cruel smile, he launched all eight knives toward the round table where Gally was hiding. The knives flew at incredible speed, striking the table and tearing it apart as if it were tissue paper.

"You little brat, calling yourself a Hunter! You think you can get away with that?!" He spat in anger as he approached the spot where the table had been, intending to stomp on Gally’s remains. But when he arrived, all he saw were shattered wooden pieces. No body, not even a trace of a cyborg arm.

"Up here, you idiot!" He looked up in panic, cold sweat beading on his face, only to find Gally hanging from the ceiling pipes. She had leaped to the ceiling at the last moment, avoiding the knives that had destroyed the table.

"Damn brat!" the man roared, his face contorted with rage as he began to hurl knives wildly at her, desperate to strike his elusive target. Gally dodged the inaccurately thrown blades with calm precision and swiftly closed the distance. With a sharp jab, she pierced the face of the man with the 76,000-chip bounty, killing him instantly. She shook off the blood splattering from her fist and exhaled quietly. The fear she had felt before the fight dissipated like mist, leaving her composed, as if she were merely walking through her living room.

"One more left." As Gally turned her gaze toward the counter, a high-pitched scream emanated from the last remaining target, the woman with the 81,000-chip bounty. The woman backed away in terror, clutching a pile of chips. Bottles crashed to the floor from the liquor shelf behind her, shattering loudly.

"P-please, spare me!" the woman begged through her tears, desperately placing a pile of chips on the counter. "There are 100,000 chips here. If you let me live, I'll give you another 50,000. Come on, it’s better than turning my head into the Factory, right? Look, you want these chips, don’t you?"

Gally silently approached the woman, grabbed her collar across the counter, and lifted her up. "The chips don't matter," Gally said softly. The woman, her face etched with disbelief, kicked and struggled helplessly in midair. "P-please, don’t kill me! I don’t want to die yet!" Gally held the pathetic, flailing woman aloft for a moment, then shifted her gaze and released her carelessly. The woman collapsed backward, her face a mess of tears and snot, paralyzed by fear.

"You're not the kind of opponent I’m looking for," Gally said, turning her back on the woman, who sat on the floor in relief, her legs too weak to stand. Without bothering to take the bounty, Gally began to leave the wrecked bar.

"Hmph..." At that very moment, the woman's expression transformed drastically. The once pitiful figure, soaked in tears and snot, now radiated fury, her face contorted with rage, emanating a violent, ominous aura that made her seem like a completely different person. The woman, moving swiftly and silently, leaped over the counter like a predatory big cat, closing in on Gally's back with smooth, lethal grace. In her hands, she gripped two long needles, each about thirty centimeters, weapons that had claimed countless lives. Her most effective tactic was to feign weakness, exploiting people's sympathy only to strike them down in moments of vulnerability. The number of lives she had taken in this manner far exceeded that of her companions.

"Foolish little girl," she thought, ready to make Gally regret her moment of mercy in hell. Just as the woman moved to plunge a needle into Gally's ear, a deep voice boomed close to her ear.

"Hey, you know something? You don’t throw a finishing blow, you drop it."

The moment she heard it, the woman felt an overwhelming force grip her body, rendering her weightless. Lifted from the floor, her world flipped upside down before she could even comprehend what was happening. A split second later, her head was violently slammed into the ground, and she lost consciousness forever.

After the heavy thud, the bar returned to its eerie silence, the melancholic, sepia-toned tune of an old record playing like a lonely ghost. By the time Gally sensed the killing intent behind her and turned around, the woman was already lying on the floor, her head slumped backward. Just as the woman's head was about to collide with the ground, the mysterious figure who had intervened held a graceful bridge position, frozen in place. As the woman's body convulsed in its final moments, the figure smoothly transitioned from the bridge and stood before Gally. It was a full-body cyborg, with a bulky, square-shaped form. Despite its humanoid resemblance, the design exuded a non-human, robotic aura. Most notably, the figure had strange, distinctive hooks mounted on the backs of its hands, seemingly designed to lock onto opponents during throws.

"I watched your moves, kid. Not bad at all. But you need to tighten up—you'll get yourself killed being too soft. If you're a Hunter, you should upgrade to a combat body, even if it's a cheap one," the cyborg critiqued, grinning. Gally responded with a slightly confused expression.

"Hmm. But, mister, where were you hiding while those guys were causing all that trouble?"

The cyborg laughed heartily. "Hahaha, blame it on this secondhand body. My digestive system hasn't been working right lately, so I was off taking care of some business!"

The cyborg approached Gally with an unsteady gait, sneering as he moved closer. *Still a bit scared. Do I still not trust myself? Damn it, I’m strong enough. I beat that Colt guy, didn’t I?* Gally tried to shake off her hesitation, mentally urging herself on, but Ido's voice echoed in her mind. "Gally, you're still less than half a Hunter..."

"Damn it! Don’t underestimate me! I’m a Hunter!" Gally shouted, sharply exhaling as she forced her fear aside. She darted forward, weaving around tables and bodies as she charged at the man worth 60,000 chips, who staggered drunkenly.

"Ha ha ha! A Hunter, you say? This little girl?!" the man slurred, his voice filled with mockery. Though clearly high and unsteady, his anger flared as Gally quickly closed the gap. With a powerful swing of his curved blade, powered by his cyborg arm, he slashed at her.

Gally ducked under the sweeping blade, lowering her head to avoid the strike, then planted her right hand on the floor as she kicked her left leg upward. Using her hand as a pivot, Gally twisted her body, executing a cartwheel-like motion. Her heel arced from below in a sweeping motion, targeting the man’s temple from his blind spot. He pulled out a piece of paper and a pen from his pocket, drawing a simple map before handing it to her.

"I'm running a rental body shop now. If you come by, I've got a few hunter bodies suited for a tough girl like you. Bring along what you earned today and come check it out."

Gally carefully folded the map Bergman had given her and tucked it away before leaving the night streets, which would begin to lighten in about an hour.
