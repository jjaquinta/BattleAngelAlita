"Someone like you wandering around there in the middle of the night is bound to get preyed on," Shigu sighed, leaning against the dirty wall. "Honestly, it’s just dangerous."

"I lost sight of Ido... and then that guy, he purposely bumped into me! I didn’t know what was going on and panicked... damn it!" Gally ground her teeth in frustration, her shoulders trembling with anger. 

Shigu let out a small laugh, surprised by Gally’s unexpected show of strength. "You’re a funny one, Gally. Really funny... Makes me glad I helped you, for real."

But just then, Gally felt a chilling shift in Shigu’s soft tone, as if something more dangerous was lurking behind her words. 

"Huh?" Gally looked up at Shigu, and saw that her eyes, fixed on Gally, had grown cold and half-lidded with a sinister gaze.

"Uh, Shigu... what’s wrong?" Gally asked, confused, taking a cautious step backward.
