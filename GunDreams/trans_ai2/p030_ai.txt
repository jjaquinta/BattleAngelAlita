Her artificial parts had also weathered, been damaged, or had fallen off. More than half of her artificial spine had been severed, and it was impossible to discern any functionality from it. At this point, there was nothing in this girl’s body that could satisfy Ido’s intellectual curiosity. The remains of this cyborg girl had already become nothing more than old junk. If only I had found her a hundred years earlier. Ido let out a light sigh and scratched his head. Then, standing up, he turned his back on the girl’s remains, ready to say goodbye. She was a cute girl. If the damage had been a little less severe, I could have brought her back and added her to my underground antique collection. 

Feeling a twinge of reluctance, Ido began descending the slope. After a few steps, he looked back again. The remains of the girl were still there, lying abandoned atop the heap of scrap, bathed in the orange glow of the setting sun. 

Why is it, I wonder... She's truly a strange one. Among the countless cyborg remains, this girl alone seemed strangely vivid.
