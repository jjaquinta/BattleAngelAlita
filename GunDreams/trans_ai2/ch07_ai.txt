CHAPTER 7

There, a mix of humans and cyborgs came and went, set up stalls, peddled goods, ate and drank, scavenged for items, got drunk and passed out, sat down, and even died. Amidst the dazzling neon lights flickering in the night along the main street of the eastern district of The Scrapyard, Gally swam through the crowd with glee. Lately, Ido had been busy with daytime clinic appointments, and Gally would sneak out into the nighttime city without him noticing. On nights when she planned her escapades, she couldn't help but smile with excitement and thrill, making every effort not to be caught by Ido until he disappeared into his bedroom.

It had been three weeks since she first ventured out alone into the night, during the incident where she had her first trial as a Hunter-Warrior, facing off against Colt. The outcome of that fight was something she had learned after waking up on the maintenance bed a day later, when Ido told her what had happened.Though Gally had fought, she remembered very little about the actual battle or its progress. The only thing that stayed with her was the lingering memory of the technique she used. Every time she ventured into the night alone, she would test her strength on streetlights or other objects in deserted streets.

“Gally, don’t go hunting any bounty heads that you don’t recognize. You’re still an inexperienced Hunter, after all,” Ido had sternly told her. For a while, he had made it clear that he wouldn’t let her take on any Hunter jobs unless he was with her. Even now, Ido wasn’t entirely happy with Gally becoming a Hunter-Warrior. He worried that she might get seriously injured again, or that she would become disillusioned with the city’s crime and moral decay. He feared she might grow violent or pick up bad habits. His main concern was his deep care for Gally, who had become a vital member of his family. 

As a result, Ido had recently started sighing every time he saw Gally, though she, seemingly unaware, remained carefree. “I’m much stronger than Ido thinks. He doesn’t trust me enough,” Gally muttered to herself, leaning against a streetlamp that illuminated the night streets. She puffed up her thick lips in slight frustration.Gally pouted, her lips still pursed in dissatisfaction. She didn't fully understand that Ido's worries were unrelated to her high abilities or trustworthiness. Being naturally straightforward, Gally had a tendency to understand things very simply. While she could grasp the idea that "being strong means there's nothing to worry about," she struggled to comprehend the more nuanced concern that "even if you're strong, that doesn’t stop someone from worrying."

Crouching under the streetlight, Gally watched the flow of people passing by. With only three months' worth of memories, everything still felt new and exciting to her, including simply observing people move through the city. There had even been times when she got so absorbed in watching the never-ending flow of people late into the night that she didn't realize the sky had begun to lighten with dawn.

"Hmm? Who’s that?" she murmured, her attention caught by a group passing nearby. Gally pulled out a crumpled piece of paper from her pocket and glanced between the paper and the people walking by, comparing them. Her eyes lit up, and she stood, eagerly following them into the crowd. The crumpled paper in her hand was a printed bounty list.Gally had obtained the crumpled bounty list two days earlier during the day when she accessed the interface of a Factory security information management robot, "Netman," on the street. *Ido, tonight I’ll go out on my own again, without telling you, and do a perfectly fine job as a Hunter-Warrior. Soon, you’ll recognize that I can handle everything on my own,* she thought to herself.

"Sixty thousand, seventy-six thousand, eighty-one thousand..." Gally mumbled as she repeated the bounty amounts while pushing through the crowd. The three bounties she had spotted were worth 60,000 chips, 76,000 chips, and 81,000 chips, respectively. For Gally, who was still being supported by Ido, these amounts didn't hold much meaning financially. However, using the bounty as a measure of how dangerous the criminals were made it easier for her to remember than just their names.

As Gally followed the trio through the bustling street, pondering when and where she should strike, they suddenly disappeared into one of the small shops lined along the street. "Oh no, I lost them," she muttered, getting swept along by the crowd like a leaf in the wind. After some effort, she finally made her way to the front of the shop. Gally bent over, resting her hands on her knees, taking a deep breath, and then looked up at the shop’s sign.As Gally lifted her head, she saw the strange name of the bar, "Gamma Ray," written above the entrance. *"If I go in here, there’s no worry about them escaping, but if a fight breaks out in there..."* Gally knew that if she entered the bar, her presence would immediately stand out, and it would become difficult to continue tailing the two bounty targets. Worse, she might be forced into a brawl inside the bar, with other customers likely around.

As a beginner Hunter-Warrior, it was ideal to lure her targets into an open space where she could fight without worrying about bystanders. But to do that, she’d need to wait outside patiently for the two to leave the bar. However, that wasn’t a good option for Gally, who needed to be home before dawn.

*"Ugh... hmm... ah, whatever!"* After pacing back and forth in front of the bar entrance with her mouth in a frustrated frown, Gally finally shook her head vigorously and grabbed the door handle.

Just as she turned the old knob and pulled to open the door, there was a loud crash, and the door suddenly burst open from the inside with a scream, as if it had exploded.Several women, terrified, screamed as they rushed out into the street, one after another. One woman had a deep cut across her back and collapsed from blood loss before she could reach the crowded street. Gally, standing at the entrance of the bar, quietly closed the door behind her with a soft "click" that somehow sounded louder than the faint melody of the old record playing inside the dimly lit bar.

There wasn't a single intact table or chair in the room—most had been smashed or toppled over, lying in pieces on the floor. Among the wreckage were the lifeless bodies of several unlucky patrons who hadn’t managed to escape in time.Gally felt her body twitch for a moment as she took in the scene of destruction. *Am I trembling?* she thought to herself. *What am I scared of? Get a grip.* She mentally repeated these words, trying to calm her body, which was becoming stiff with tension. Gally took a deep breath, silently, so as not to be noticed. 

The three bounty heads who had rampaged through the bar, leaving nothing living behind, were enjoying the aftermath of their violence, completely oblivious to Gally. A man standing against the wall with only his arms and legs cybernetically enhanced, worth a bounty of 60,000 chips, held a bloodstained curved blade in one hand, his unfocused eyes staring blankly into space after taking a hit of synthetic drugs. A second man, worth 76,000 chips, fully cybernetic and clad in a black coat, sat calmly at the counter, pouring himself a glass of bourbon, his demeanor unfitting of the brutal scene around him. The third, a black woman, also fully cybernetic and worth 81,000 chips, was rifling through the bar’s storage, counting the stolen cash she’d found in the safe with obvious glee.

"What a vile thing to do," Gally muttered under her breath.Gally spoke out loud to the three, her voice cutting through the air. "Closing time, you bastards."

The man worth 76,000 chips, who was casually drinking whiskey, muttered a response without even turning to face her. "So what? That just means there's no one left to get in our way."

Gally replied with as steady a voice as she could muster, but the slight tremble at the end of her words made her curse silently to herself. Until now, the three bounty heads had barely reacted to the lone girl in front of them. But Gally’s provocation had changed that. In an instant, they all turned their eyes toward her, their hostile glares and palpable malice suddenly electrifying the air in the dimly lit bar.

Surrounded by their deadly intent, Gally felt a tremor run through her once again.

"Hah! Heh heh, look at this little kitten here, talking tough," sneered the man worth 60,000 chips, leaning against the wall and holding a broad curved blade. His drug-fueled body swayed as he laughed mockingly. "She’s shaking... She’s scared stiff, huh?"The man approached Gally with an unsteady gait, sneering as he moved closer. Still a bit scared. Do I still not trust myself? Damn it, I’m strong enough. I beat that Colt guy, didn’t I? Gally tried to shake off her hesitation, mentally urging herself on, but Ido's voice echoed in her mind. "Gally, you're still less than half a Hunter..."

"Damn it! Don’t underestimate me! I’m a Hunter!" Gally shouted, sharply exhaling as she forced her fear aside. She darted forward, weaving around tables and bodies as she charged at the man worth 60,000 chips, who staggered drunkenly.

"Ha ha ha! A Hunter, you say? This little girl?!" the man slurred, his voice filled with mockery. Though clearly high and unsteady, his anger flared as Gally quickly closed the gap. With a powerful swing of his curved blade, powered by his cyborg arm, he slashed at her. 

Gally ducked under the sweeping blade, lowering her head to avoid the strike, then planted her right hand on the floor as she kicked her left leg upward. Using her hand as a pivot, Gally twisted her body, executing a cartwheel-like motion. Her heel came up from below, in a sweeping arc, aimed at the man’s temple from his blind spot.Gally’s reverse roundhouse kick echoed through the room with the sound of bones shattering, sending the head of the 60,000-chip man flying through the air. "Two more to go!" Gally shouted as she spun across the floor, ready for her next target. The man worth 76,000 chips, momentarily stunned by her unexpected combat prowess, stood up from the counter, baring his teeth before spitting on the floor in fury.

"You brat! Damn you!" he snarled, flinging open the front of his black coat. Inside, it was lined with throwing knives, like silver scales. With practiced ease, he grabbed four in each hand, eight in total. "Take this!" he roared, hurling the knives with speed and precision, aiming directly at Gally as she closed the distance. 

Sensing the danger, Gally swiftly dodged to the side, causing the knives to miss their mark and pierce the floor instead, riddling it with holes like a honeycomb. Gally rolled to the side and used a fallen round table as cover, stopping her movement to conceal herself behind it."My knives have been underestimated, huh? You think a flimsy wooden shield will stop me?!" The man, using the full power of his cyborg arm, hurled his knives with such force that they could easily pierce through two and a half centimeters of steel. With a cruel smile, he launched all eight knives toward the round table where Gally was hiding. The knives flew at incredible speed, striking the table and tearing it apart as if it were tissue paper.

"You little brat, calling yourself a Hunter! You think you can get away with that?!" He spat in anger as he approached the spot where the table had been, intending to stomp on Gally’s remains. But when he got there, all he saw were shattered wooden pieces. No body, not even a trace of a cyborg arm.

"Up here, you idiot!" He looked up in a panic, cold sweat running down his face, only to find Gally hanging from the ceiling pipes. She had jumped to the ceiling at the last moment, avoiding the knives that destroyed the table.

"Damn brat!" the man roared, his face twisting with rage as he began to hurl knives wildly at her, trying to hit his elusive target.Gally dodged the inaccurately thrown knives with calm precision and swiftly closed the distance. With a sharp jab, she pierced the face of the man with the 76,000 chip bounty, killing him instantly. She shook off the blood splattering from her fist and quietly exhaled. The fear she had felt before the fight had vanished like mist, leaving her in a composed state of mind, as if she were walking through her living room.

"One more left." As Gally turned her gaze toward the counter, a high-pitched scream escaped the last remaining target, the woman with the 81,000 chip bounty. The woman backed away in terror, clutching a pile of chips. Bottles crashed to the floor from the liquor shelf behind her, shattering loudly.

"P-please, spare me!" the woman begged through her tears, desperately placing a pile of chips on the counter. "There are 100,000 chips here. If you let me live, I'll give you another 50,000. Come on, it’s better than turning my head in to the Factory, right? Look, you want these chips, don’t you?"Gally silently approached the woman, grabbed her collar across the counter, and lifted her up. "The chips don't matter," Gally said softly. The woman, her face filled with disbelief, kicked and struggled helplessly in midair. "P-please, don’t kill me! I don’t want to die yet!" Gally held the pathetic, flailing woman aloft for a moment, then shifted her gaze and carelessly released her. The woman collapsed backward, her face a mess of tears and snot, paralyzed by fear.

"You're not the kind of opponent I’m looking for," Gally said, turning her back on the woman, who sat on the floor in relief, her legs too weak to stand. Without bothering to take the bounty, Gally began to leave the wrecked bar.

"Hmph..." At the very moment Gally turned her back, the woman's expression drastically changed. The once pathetic figure, covered in tears and snot, now radiated fury, her face contorted with rage, emanating a violent, ominous aura that made her seem like a completely different person.The woman, moving swiftly and silently, leaped over the counter like a big cat, closing in on Gally's back with a smooth, predatory speed. In her hands, she gripped two long needles, each about 30 centimeters, weapons that had claimed countless lives. Her most effective tactic was to feign weakness, exploiting people's sympathy, only to strike them down in a moment of vulnerability. The number of people she had killed this way far exceeded that of her companions. "Foolish little girl," she thought, ready to make Gally regret her moment of mercy in hell. Just as the woman moved to plunge a needle into Gally's ear, it happened.

"Hey, you know something? You don’t throw a finishing blow, you drop it." A deep voice boomed close to her ear. The moment she heard it, the woman felt an overwhelming force on her body, and suddenly, she was weightless. Lifted from the floor, her world flipped upside down before she could even comprehend what was happening. A split second later, her head was violently slammed into the ground, and she lost consciousness forever. 

After the heavy thud, the bar returned to its eerie silence, with only the melancholic, sepia-toned tune of an old record playing like a lonely ghost. By the time Gally sensed the killing intent behind her and turned around, the woman was already lying on the floor, her head slumped backward.Just as the woman's head was about to slam into the floor, the mysterious figure who had thrown her held a graceful bridge position, frozen in place. As the woman's body convulsed in its final moments, the figure smoothly transitioned out of the bridge and stood before Gally. It was a full-body cyborg, with a bulky, square-shaped form. Despite resembling a humanoid, the design gave off a non-human, robotic vibe. Most notably, the figure had strange, distinctive hooks mounted on the back of its hands, seemingly designed to lock onto opponents during throws.

"I watched your moves, kid. Not bad at all. But you need to tighten up—you'll get yourself killed being too soft. If you're a Hunter, you should upgrade to a combat body, even if it's a cheap one." The man, who had suddenly appeared and saved Gally, grinned as he offered his critique. Gally responded with a slightly confused expression.

"Hmm. But, mister, where were you hiding while those guys were causing all that trouble?"

The man laughed heartily. "Hahaha, blame it on this secondhand body. My digestive system hasn't been working right lately, so I was off taking care of some business!"The man approached Gally with an unsteady gait, sneering as he moved closer. Still a bit scared. Do I still not trust myself? Damn it, I’m strong enough. I beat that Colt guy, didn’t I? Gally tried to shake off her hesitation, mentally urging herself on, but Ido's voice echoed in her mind. "Gally, you're still less than half a Hunter..."

"Damn it! Don’t underestimate me! I’m a Hunter!" Gally shouted, sharply exhaling as she forced her fear aside. She darted forward, weaving around tables and bodies as she charged at the man worth 60,000 chips, who staggered drunkenly.

"Ha ha ha! A Hunter, you say? This little girl?!" the man slurred, his voice filled with mockery. Though clearly high and unsteady, his anger flared as Gally quickly closed the gap. With a powerful swing of his curved blade, powered by his cyborg arm, he slashed at her. 

Gally ducked under the sweeping blade, lowering her head to avoid the strike, then planted her right hand on the floor as she kicked her left leg upward. Using her hand as a pivot, Gally twisted her body, executing a cartwheel-like motion. Her heel came up from below, in a sweeping arc, aimed at the man’s temple from his blind spot.He pulled out a piece of paper and a pen from his pocket and drew a simple map, handing it to her. "I'm running a rental body shop now. If you come by, I've got a few hunter bodies suited for a tough girl like you. Bring along what you earned today and come check it out."

Gally carefully folded the map Bergman gave her and tucked it away before leaving the night streets, which would start to lighten in about an hour.
