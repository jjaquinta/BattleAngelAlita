"Damn it, a red light shot up from beneath the shadow."

The brilliant light curved like a giant snake from the ground to the sky, then disappeared into the darkness. Almost simultaneously, the resistance he felt in his machete from centrifugal force vanished, and a high, clear ringing sound echoed off the walls of the dark alley.

"Wha...?!"

The man was struck by a sense of unease as the expected thrill of sinking his blade into his enemy's skull was absent. Just before the machete could make contact with the shadowâ€™s head, the resistance vanished somewhere, and the man, now feeling like something had slipped through his grasp, continued to bring his left arm down to the ground. As if pulled by the force of his own swing, the man somersaulted through the air and landed awkwardly on his back, rolling over.

"Heeyahhh, m-my arm, aahhh!"

The man finally became aware of his loss, letting out a scream only after he had landed painfully on his back and reached behind him with his left arm. His left mechanical arm had been severed at the wrist during that brief exchange with the shadow. His machine arm revealed a sharp, clean cut, faintly emitting smoke as it radiated heat.

The shadow stood before the man as if nothing had happened.
