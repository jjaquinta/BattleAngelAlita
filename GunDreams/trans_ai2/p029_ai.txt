Her face. Though her closed eyes weren't particularly long and narrow, they were rather large. Her nose was small but had a straight and defined bridge. Her mouth, although small, had full, plump lips both on the upper and lower parts, leaving a striking impression. She must have been a pretty girl. But it's surprising that her head remained undamaged. Ido let out a faint smile, gently touching the girl's cheek. The synthetic skin had inevitably weathered, and even a light touch caused fine cracks, like worn-out rubber, to appear.

Ido shifted his observation from the girl’s face to her body, searching for any functional discoveries. While she may not have been a high-end model, the girl's body, created with technology from centuries ago, must have been magnificent. It was easy to imagine that traces of advanced cyborg technology—far superior to the current, regressed techniques—would be present throughout her body. As a cyber-physician, Ido’s heart raced with excitement. 

However, he couldn’t make any concrete observations. When he dug out more of her body from the scrap, it became apparent that apart from her peaceful, sleeping-like expression, the rest of her body was critically damaged. Her arms were missing, as were her legs. Her torso below the chest was severely damaged, and most of her artificial organs and neural systems were destroyed.
