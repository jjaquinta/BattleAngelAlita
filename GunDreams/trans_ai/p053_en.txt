Gally turned off the light in her room and crawled into bed, but she couldn’t fall asleep.
Then, about two hours later.
As she slowly regained consciousness, a hard sound echoed in her ears.
While lying in bed, just as her excited mind was about to fall asleep, that faint sound suddenly became strangely real, knocking on Gally’s awareness.
What is that, at this time?
Gally noticed. The room, despite the lights being off, was unexpectedly illuminated quite clearly.
It’s Ido...
Gally jumped out of bed as she heard the hard sound of footsteps passing by her room and descending the stairs. A little while later, she faintly heard the door to the clinic open and close. Gally leaped out of bed, approached the curtained window, and gently lifted the edge. From the clinic entrance downstairs, she saw a figure dressed in black stepping out into the street.
