"Those arms and legs of yours, they're all from our dead or missing prostitute friends. Gally, where did you get those limbs?"
"Where? Well, Ido fixed my entire body."
When Gally said that, the women murmured the name "Ido." Their voices were filled with anger.
"So, the one who killed Stear is that Ido guy, huh?"
"Walsa too."
"Uzzi was killed as well..."
Gally felt a sharp sting in her head as the murderous intent of the women intensified.
"What are these people talking about? Lately, a serial killer has been prowling around here. Us prostitutes have especially been hit hard. Several of our friends have been killed by that bastard. And just when we were thinking of how to deal with that killer, you show up wearing parts from one of our murdered friends."
