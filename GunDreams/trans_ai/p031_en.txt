Even though Ido had already confirmed that the girl’s body was nothing more than scrap, for some reason, he couldn’t shake the feeling that she wasn’t truly dead. This wasn’t like him at all. The emergency battery was half-destroyed and completely useless. There was nothing in this girl's body that could still function. The only part left to check was the contents of her head.

As he muttered to himself, Ido suddenly stopped in his tracks.

"Her heart and lungs had long since ceased functioning. Her liver was missing. The generator was gone. There’s no way this girl's brain has been preserved."

But even as he mocked himself for such thoughts, Ido let out a breath, his lips twisting into a self-deprecating smile. There's no way the girl’s brain could still be intact within that decayed skull. It wasn’t possible for her brain to have survived without any life-supporting machinery, but... could it really still be there?
