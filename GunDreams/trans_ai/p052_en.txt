"I'm tired today. I've had some drinks too... I'm going to bed early," Ido said as he stood up from his chair in the living room. Gally tugged at the hem of Ido's jacket, looking up at him with pleading eyes.
"Hey, Ido, are you already going to sleep? Is that the end of the story about the outside world for today?"
Gally had gained the freedom to move again. She was especially curious about the outside world, and even though she had only walked around the front of the clinic, the stories about The Scrapyard were intriguing enough in Gally's limited worldview to make her lean forward with interest.
"Yeah, sorry, but tonightâ€™s not going to happen. I'll take you out when I have some free time. So, for tonight, don't stay up late and just go to bed," Ido said as he wearily left the living room. Even though Gally puffed up her cheeks in dissatisfaction, there was nothing she could do but return to her room and go to sleep.
