When she pulled it out, her fingers pinched a few wrinkled, paper-rolled cigarettes. The woman put one of them in her mouth, lit it, and took a long, slow drag as if taking a deep breath.

Being a full-body cyborg, the woman didn’t have the ability to absorb the smoke. Her artificial lungs filtered the nicotine but couldn’t process it. Moreover, she couldn’t even hope for the calming effects of nicotine. Yet, doing so gave her mind a sense of peace, mechanically passing the time in unconscious habit. The brain, though housed in a mechanized body, remembered the ritual of smoking from when she had a human body — a "pseudo-act" that brought a sense of stability to her otherwise artificial existence.

His left eye remained open, staring into the void, frozen in a grimace of agony, teeth clenched tightly. It was said that heads like his — bearing such a cursed expression — had to be properly buried and enshrined to prevent misfortune.
