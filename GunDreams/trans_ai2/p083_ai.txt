"But that's not why I dug you out of the scrapyard," Ido said, turning his back on Gally, ready to leave the room. "You don't understand how ugly and dirty battle really is." 

As Ido walked away, Gally shouted at his retreating figure, "I know, Ido! I know you're a Hunter Warrior! If fighting is so ugly and dirty, why are *you* doing it?" 

Her words struck Ido like the tip of a spear, causing him to flinch. "What? So... you knew, huh? That's how you learned about the Hunter Warriors, Gally... I see." 

Even though Gally was rattled by her own words, she gathered her strength and pleaded with Ido in a trembling voice. "I'm sorry... for following you. But I realized how much danger you put yourself in to restore me. I can't let you face such filthy, dangerous things all by yourself, not just for me!"
