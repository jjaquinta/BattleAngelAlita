"Hehehe... How does it feel, Gally? Slowly being dismantled from the edges... Cyborgs tend to neglect defending their limbs because they don't feel pain there. My fighting style exploits that by systematically destroying the extremities and rendering them useless," Norinco cackled. 

Gally, desperate to fend him off, racked her brain to find a weakness in the old man's brutal tactics. So far, Norinco had only been vulnerable to reckless, sacrificial attacks. Gally recalled the advice from Calico: "If you focus on feints and deceptive moves, you'll have a chance."

Suddenly, clarity struck her. "That's it... That's how I can win," Gally realized. 

Though her limbs had been nearly stripped bare by Norincoâ€™s relentless hand strikes, a glimmer of determination returned to her dark eyes. "This is it!" she yelled. Dodging Norinco's next strike, Gally sprinted toward one of the pillars supporting the dilapidated structure. With a powerful hand chop, she shattered the column.

The roof and framework of the ruin, already precariously balanced, began to collapse with a deafening rumble, brought down by Gally's decisive blow.
