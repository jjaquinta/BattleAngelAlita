### EPILOGUE

I am deeply grateful to Mr. Kishiro (though addressing him as "Mr." feels a bit awkward) and Deputy Editor-in-Chief Hasaka for their unwavering support. This novel explores the themes of "reality and unreality," delving into how the characters navigate and grapple with these profound concepts.

At the heart of the story are three complex characters: the violent Colt, who defines truth as the mere satisfaction of desires; Norinco, burdened by an unfulfilling past who escapes reality by embracing fiction as truth, accompanied by a doll embodying his dual personality; and Ido, a compassionate doctor with a hunter's taste for murder, in pursuit of an ideal detached from reality. Each of these characters confronts their own distinct realities and unique truths, where nothing is certain. Central to the narrative is Gally, whose earnest struggle to face and reflect upon these challenges forms the emotional core of this work.

Additionally, elements such as the existence of Calico—a disciple of Clive Lee—the intricacies of the rental body shop, and the dynamic martial arts scenes were incorporated to infuse the story with the vibrant energy of "Kawamura Original." I hope these additions succeeded in enriching the narrative and bringing an added layer of excitement and depth to the story.

When I was an assistant, my teacher encouraged me with the words, "Go your own way," and then let me go. The following year, in his New Year's card, he wrote, "Strike out boldly." These words of encouragement resonated deeply with me. However, when I was approached to write this novel after a prolonged period without publishing any work, I couldn't help but envision myself stumbling and struggling with my own inadequacies. Initially, I contemplated declining the offer, fearing the confrontation with my own limitations.

Yet, reflecting on why my teacher—whom I often thought of as a "frog in a well"—would entrust me with the opportunity to see the vastness of the sky, I realized I couldn't refuse. He recognized the potential within me, even as he worried that I wasn't fully confronting my own abilities. Embracing this, I knew that, as a "frog," I needed to rise to the occasion, taking on this challenge to honor my teacher and to grow for my own sake.

Yukito-san, thank you for always sparring with me using the bamboo sword. Your guidance has been invaluable.

This is the backstory behind this novel. My hope is that as many people as possible will resonate with it and feel, "That was good." It is an honor to have you read it.
