"Will I make it home before Ido gets back...?" Gally ran through the dark alleys at a quick pace. By the time she returned home from the entertainment district, she was luckyâ€”Ido hadn't returned yet. He likely had to stop by the Factory to cash in the bounty, which is why he was later than Gally.

When Gally let her guard down, it felt as if her soul had been drained, leaving her in a daze. The brief encounter with Kyariko replayed in her mind.

"What happened, Gally? Your body has dents and scratches all over," Ido said in a concerned tone, tightening the bolts on the maintenance hatch of Gally's body as she lay on the bed.
