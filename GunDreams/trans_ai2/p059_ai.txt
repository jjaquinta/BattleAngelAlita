Everyone was just watching Gally’s panicked face. Not a single person came to her aid. *I’m all alone…* In her cornered state, she felt the weight of that realization settle in, along with a deep sense of despair. Even her only ally, Ido, wasn’t there to help her now.

“I’m gonna smash that scared little face of yours with my hammer blow! That’ll finally fix the pain in my heart!” 

The bull-headed cyborg thrust out his literal iron fist, which was about the same size as Gally's head. 

“Prepare yourself, baby! Heavenly knock-out punch!”

From his right-side stance, the bull-headed cyborg stepped forward with his right foot, using the momentum to drive his entire right arm and shoulder into a full-powered punch. The surprisingly solid straight punch from the joking bull-headed cyborg was aimed right at Gally’s crouched face.

"Uwaaaaahhh!"
